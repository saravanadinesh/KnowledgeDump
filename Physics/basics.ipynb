    "# Fundamental Interactions\n",
    "There are four fundamental interactions anmely gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear and weak nuclear. Of these gravity is the weakest - compared to gravity, electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear interactions are $10^{36}$, $10^{38}$, $10^{25}$ times stronger respectively. Gravity and electromagnetic interactions have infinite range, whereas, strong and weak nuclear interactions do not. While electromagnetic interactions dominate at atomic scales, when it comes to astronomical distances, gravity dominates because large bodies are electrically neutral (positive and negative charges cancel out), whereas gravity doesn't cancel out as there is no such a thing as positive and negative gravity - or anti-gravity. So gravity always attracts and never repels. \n",

    "## Gravity\n",
    "Mass is the property of an object that causes it to experience a force when it is placed in a gravitational field. This force is given by Newton's law of gravitation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F=G{\\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $G$ is the Gravitational constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following points about the above equation are noteworthy: \n",
    "+ $F$ acts on both objects in question. Each object experiences an acceleration equal to $F$ divided by their mass. So a small object close to earth would accelerate towards earth and the earth would also accelerate towards the small object, but the acceleration is negligible because earth's mass is very large. \n",
    "+ $F$ on $r$ the distance between the two objects. This means that, as the two objects get closer and closer as they are attracted towards each other, the force increases. So gravity is more of a yank (derivative of force) than a force. \n",
    "+ $r$ is not the distance between the surfaces of the masses, but their centers. So $r$ will almost never become $0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last point above has an interesting implication for free falling objects on earth: As the object falls towards earth the distance between the center of the earth and the center of the object changes negligibly, because earth's radius so large. So instead of a yank, one can approximate gravity to a force. Consequently, the object will experience a constant acceleration (instead of a jerk) as given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g = \\frac{F}{m} = G{\\frac{m_g}{r^2_g}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where, $m_g$ and $r_g$ are the mass and radius of the earth. $g$ is simply called the \"gravitational field of earth\" and is approximately $9.8 m/s^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Electromagnetism\n",
    "Charge is the property of an object that causes it to feel a force, attracting or repelling, when placed in an electric field. This force is given by Coloumb's law:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = K_e{\\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where, $K_e$ is the Couloumb's constant. The parallels between this formula and Newton's universal law of gravitation are quite obvious\n",
    "\n",
    "# Work and Energy\n",
    "When an object is moved by a distance $r$ against a force $F$ work is said to be done. Or conversely, when a force $F$ is applied on an object across a distance $r$, work is done. Work is defined as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "W = F*r\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Work can be thought of as energy transferred to a system, or as change in energy in the system. Therefore work and energy share the same unit of measurement, namely, joules. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given Newton's law of gravitation and Coloumb's law, one can think of moving an object of a certain mass against gravitational force, or equivalently, move a charge againt an electric force. This means that mechanical and electrical energy are equivalent to each other. Thermal energy, or thermal work, is defined equivalently as well. The basic idea is to convert mechanical energy completely into thermal energy using friction and then measuring it. In fact, Joule was the one who established this equivalence using an [apparatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)#History) that had a falling weight drive a paddle wheel in water, which due to friction, resulted in heating up the water. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without some type of friction, kinetic energy (mechanical energy) or electrical energy cannot be converted into other forms of energy (example: light, heat). Friction is the thing that resists the movement of an object. Resistance in an electrical circuit is basically friction. Friction, as it opposes a force, is also represented as a force and its unit is Newtons. Since law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, if kinetic energy isn't converted into some other form (ex. thermal), the kinetic energy will not diminish. For example, a flywheel encountering no air resistance and no friction around its axle with theoritically keep spinning forever after a momentary force is applied. At a later time, if some more force is applied, it will increase the rpm of the flywheel and it will then continue spinning at this new rpm. This is infact the principle behind storing energy in a flywheel - the flywheel is caged in a vacuum (hence no air resistance) and instead of ball bearings, it floats around the axle on a magnetic field (hence, almost zero resistance). One can think of other examples, such as a pendulum swinging back and forth forever in a friction-less system, or a car going up and down a sinusoidal terrain. The pendulum, after the application of a momentary force (like pulling it and letting it go), would swing forever in a frictionless system, and a car, once pulled to the peak of a hill of a sinusoidal terrain) and let go, would keep traveling forever without needing any fuel, as long as it experiences no air resistance or friction on its tyres. \n",

    "## Energy generation and consumption\n",
    "Energy in nature is available continuously, whether it is hydro energy from a flowing river or wind energy or thermal energy or nuclear energy. The concept of power, which is energy/sec, hence is, oftentimes, more important than total energy. For example, when designing a water wheel based crane or a solar panel system for generating electricity of a household, thinking anout energy - i.e. energy that could be generated, forever, in the system, is meaningless. Energy generated per unit of time informs the design. You can similarly think of heat energy produced by wood vs. gasoline. A piece of wood may produce the same amount of thermal energy as a small cup of gasoline, but wood would release its energy very slowly over a long period of time while gasoline would release all its energy very quickly. This is why wood is used in the fireplace to heat the house and gasoline is used in an internal combustion engine and not vice-versa - In other words, it is the energy/sec that informs the application and not the total energy.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In a system that **doesn't have any mechanism of energy storage**, energy produced per second needs to be consumed (pretty much) within that second. So, if we don't connect any load to the water wheel crane, the continuous energy acting on the water wheel would keep increasing its rpm, and eventually, the water wheel would break up due to some sort of stress - or if the bearing offer a tiny bit of resistance, they will heat up, become red hot, get destroyed, causing the wheel to brush against the axle at high speed causing to break or catch fire. If the main power generation system in a country is fossil fuel based, then safety mechanisms already exist to ensure that, if the load isn't consuming energy at a assumed rate, to protect the energy production mechanism from getting destroyed. For example, in a thermal plant, they will slow down coal burning if the consumption goes down slowly, or let off steam in case a sudden load reduction (like when circuit break happens)[[Ref]](https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-electricity-that-is-not-used?share=1). In fact, the turbine rpm needs to be maintained strictly as the power supply needs to be working at 50Hz/60Hz. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many early steam engine designs carried with them the danger of boiler explosions: The guy throwing coal into the engine might throw too much coal and the boiler pressure would build up because the load wasn't using it up. The latter is because of speed governing \"centrifugal governer\" that shuts off steam from the boiler into the cyclinders whenever rpm increases. Eventually unless someone glances upon the pressure gauge and manually release some steam, the boiler would explode. This is where the term \"letting off steam\" or \"blowing off steam\" comes from. Later automatic pressure release safety valves made the job of the guy letting off steam redundant. This letting off steam is particularly important when the train comes to the station to stop, but the boiler is still going and the pressure keeps building up. Also before the train leaves the station, it lets out a lot of steam as the boiler has to be started much earlier and the signal may not be still green. As the wheels are engaged and the locomotive starts moving, the steam it [lets out decreases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z8MIXXDPls)\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of renewables, in most countries, they aren't the main source of power and just augment conventional power production mechanisms. In this case, all electricity they produce, above their average production level, will be taken up by the grid and the conventional mechanisms adjust by producing less electricity. But if renewables become the primary source of energy production, then some sort of safety mechanism needs to be implemented to protect them from destroying themselves in the scenario of production of energy exceeding consumption. While one can reduce coal supply to a thermal generator or pull rods out of a nuclear reactor and control energy production, for solar, wind power, such mechanisms are nearly impossible. In wind, sometimes the blade angle is adjusted to reduce production, but this is indeed a strain on the wind turnbine and will reduce its lifetime. The only way out would be to use energy storage mechanisms. For hydro-electric plants that operate out of a dam, the dam itself is the energy storage mechanism - the doors of the dam can be opened/closed depending upon load requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Energy storage is also required for smoothening out supply: No matter how good a rpm control system in a thermal or nuclear power plant are, they will not be butter smooth. This is why flywheels are added to car engines, because energy storage mechanisms smoothen out the energy supply. In electrical systems, inductors and capacitors are energy storage mechanisms.Any mechanism that can be used for energy storage can be used for smoothening out energy supply and vice-versa. \n",

    "## Playing with knobs \n",
    "Mechanical energy can be broken down into its components as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E (joules) = mass(kg)*acceleration(m/s^2)*distance(m)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Between energy production point and consumption point, one can consider the right hand side parameters as knobs and increase some, decrease some, and keep the energy constant. For example, suppose we have a water wheel operating a crane that is lifting iron ore up a conveyor belt at a slope. Suppose water hitting the wheel is falling from a height of 100m to ground, then each kg of water would pack 980 joules of energy. Suppose water is flowing at a rate of 1 lit/sec, or, 1 kg/sec, then this means, power is 980 watts. If the iron ore production mechanism dumpts 0.5kg ore on the conveyor belt per second, then the iron ore current is 0.5kg/sec. Consequently, one kg of water would do a work lifting 0.5kg or iron ore to a height of 200m. Here, the water current changed from 1 kg/sec to an iron ore current of 0.5 kg/sec. But the energy per kg change doubled from 980 joules per kg to 1960 per kg, all the while power remained at a constant value of 980 watts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Joules per kg is the mechanical equivalent of voltage and kg/sec is the mechanical equivalent of current. What we have shown in the above example is that, we can keep $Power = Voltage*Current$ constant while we double the voltage and half the current. In electrical systems this is done by transformers (and mass is replaced with charge)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Electrical energy\n",
    "Voltage is potential energy per charge (Joules/coulomb) and current is rate of flow of charge (coulomb/sec). Hence, voltage times current gives power (Joules/sec).\n",
    "\n",
    "An inductor is the electrical equivalent of a spring. If a horizontal spring is attached to a load on one side, if one where to apply a horizontal force on the spring from the other side (basically push it), intially the spring will compress, but the load will feel no force at all in the beginning and hence won't move. But if one continues to apply the force, the load will start feeling more and more of the force. Eventually, at some point, the spring will fully compress and from that point on, the load will feel all the pressure applied to the spring. Basically the spring will act like an \"open\" at the beginning, and a short after sometime. This is for a \"DC force\". If it is a high frequency AC force with a peak force value much less than what is required to fully compress the spring, then the spring would compress-decompress at high frequency and the load would feel nothing at all. In this case, when the AC force is high, it would compress the spring, and when it is low, the spring will put back the stored energy. This is why, in inductive loads, we differentiate between actual power and apparent power, because most of the power is put back into the system and hence one cannot charge a customer for that. \n",
    "\n",
    "A capacitor is like a diaphragm in a hydraulic system. If one were to have a diaphragm in a pipe that is parallel to another pipe that makes the load, then, when hydraulic pressure is applied, initially, the diaphragm will show no resistance and simply deform pushing the water beneath it - making it look like there is a current flowing through the pipe containing the diaphragm, and hence the circuit, as one can see water flowing into the pipe and equivalent water flowing out at the other end. Eventually, the diaphragm cannot expand anymore and it will stop deforming. At this point, all the pressure applied further will be fully felt by the load pipe. Here too, if a high freqency AC force is applied, the diaphram will deform and come back to original form at high frequency, but the load pipe will see no force at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "A system that has only (ideal) capacitors and inductors will conserve electrical energy as it is. But if the system has resistance, then it converts some of the electrical energy to thermal energy. In other words, resistance results in electrical energy loss, while reactance, that defines the voltage and current relationships in a purely reactive load (inductance and/or capacitance) doesn't result in electrical energy loss - it only temporarily stores energy. This is the reason why heavy inductive loads like a motor, although consume a lot of \"apparent power\", they give back a large portion of stored energy to the system which results in the \"actual power\" consumed to be much less than the \"apparent power\". Another note: When people mention \"$I^2R$\" losses while talking about, say, power loss along transmission lines, they are talking about the electrical energy that gets converted to heat and lost - While transmision lines also have reactive components, they don't result in energy \"loss\". The interesting thing to note about $I^2R$ loss is that, it doesn't depend upon the voltage of the line. This may become appareant when one thinks about the mechanical analogy - If we have a thin stream of water (small current) falling through a pipe, it may not even hit the walls of the pipe, even if the pipe is small (high resistance), no matter how great the height is from which the stream is falling (high voltage). Energy \"loss\" due to friction is entirely a matter of how much water is flowing through the pipe and not the energy per quanta of the water. This is the reason why, in power transmission lines, voltage is stepped up, while current is stepped down at the source, and then required conversion is done at where the power is used. In fact, this is what made AC the standard way of transmitting power instead of DC (Edison's DC transmission suffered a lot from $I^2R$ losses and hence the power plant needed to be closed to where the power is used. Tesla was tasked with solving the problem and he came up with AC, which, using transformers, can go though voltge step up and down, thereby reducing $I^2R$ losses during transmission. This enabled power plants to be located far away from where the power is actually consumed)\n",
