    "If the posterior probability is very different from prior probability then the evindence is highly significant. Let us look at what increases the probability of the hypotheses (prior) when a new evidence is presented: Clearly, the lower $P(e)$ is and the higher $P(e | H)$ is, the higher the posterior probability. In other words, if the probablity that the evidence occurs is in general low, but when $H$ it becomes high, then the posterior probability becomes high. On the other hand, if the chance of seeing the evindence when $H$ occurs is very low, then it lowers the probability of $H$ compared to the prior by a large amount. That also makes the evidence significant. Basically, we want to know if the presence of evidence significantly changes the story or not. "
