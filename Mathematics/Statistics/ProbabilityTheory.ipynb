    "If the posterior probability is very different from prior probability then the evindence is highly significant. Let us look at what increases the probability of the hypotheses (prior) when a new evidence is presented: Clearly, the lower $P(e)$ is and the higher $P(e | H)$ is, the higher the posterior probability. In other words, if the probablity that the evidence occurs is in general low, but when $H$ it becomes high, then the posterior probability becomes high. On the other hand, if the chance of seeing the evindence when $H$ occurs is very low, then it lowers the probability of $H$ compared to the prior by a large amount. That also makes the evidence significant. Basically, we want to know if the presence of evidence significantly changes the story or not. \n",

    "Notice that, if $P(e|H) = P(e)$, then $P(H|e) = P(H)$. There is a mirrorring of ideas here. If the posterior probability of evidence is same as the prior probability of evidence, then then posterior probability of the hypothesis is the same as the prior probability of hypothesis (and hence the evidence is useless and the hypothesis is useless)"
