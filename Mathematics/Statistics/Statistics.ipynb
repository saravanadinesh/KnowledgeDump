    "# Sufficient statistic\n",
    "Any function of observations, i.e., $f(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$ is technically a \"statistic\" (whether it is useful or not). The point of a statistic is to usually make some inferences about the distribution parameters from the statistic. Since a statistic compresses information contained in several observations into one value, a natural question is, once a statistic meant for making inferences about a distribution parameter is calculated, can we throw away the observations? - i.e., does the statistic contain all relevant information needed for us to make an inference about the distribution parameter of interest? The reason why we try to answer that question is not only that we don't need to store hundreds or thousands of observations (in the interest of conserving hard disk space, which, in this day and age, may not be a concern at all), but more importantly, it makes for convenient mathematics in many situations as we will see later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**\n",
    "Let $ X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n $ be a random sample from a probability distribution with unknown parameter $\\theta$. Then, the statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = u(X_1, X_2, ... , X_n)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is said to be sufficient for $\\theta$ if the conditional distribution of $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$, given the statistic $Y$, doesn't depend on the parameter $\\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is not a theorem, but a definition. The intuition behind this choice of definition is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability distribution of $ \\mathbf X = [X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n]^T $ is parameterised by $\\theta$\n",
    "2. If, now, knowing the value of $Y$ we could tell the probability of $\\mathbf{X}$ without knowing anything about $\\theta$, then it means, the impact that $\\theta$ had on the probability of $\\mathbf{X}$ is \"contained\" within $Y$. So the inverse must be true as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Factorisation theorem\n",
    "Let $ X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n $ denote random variables with joint probability density function or joint probability mass function $ f(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n; \\theta) $, which depends on the parameter $\\theta$. Then, the statistic $ Y = u(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n) $ is sufficient for $\\theta$ if and only if the p.d.f (or p.m.f.) can be factored into two components, that is:\n",

    "*Proof* (For the discrete case): Suppose we can factorize we can factorise the pmf as: $ P(\\mathbf{X};\\theta) = \\phi[u(\\mathbf{x});\\theta] h(\\mathbf{x})$, then we can find $P(Y = y)$ as shown below:\n",
