    "\n",
    "## Measurements\n",
    "+ Decibel level in audio is noise level in reference to human hearing threshold, which is 20micropascal pressure on a diaphragm (So 0dB is human hearing threshold). It is measured using a sound meter in which the diaphragm converts pressure to electricity and decibel level is obtained as \n",

    "So, compared to light rain (40 dB), a normal conversation (50 dB) is 10 times louder (powerful or energy/sec ful) and a noisy restaurant is 10,000 times louder!\n",
    "\n",
    "+ dBFS - decibel relative to full scale is a measurement that is defined only for digital signals (and not analog signals). 0 dBFS is the maximum possible digital level; A signal that is half the range is -6dBFS and so on. The SQNR [formula for a quantizer](#Quantizer-noise) represents the minimum noise floor in dBFS for a system (with neg sign) that deals with an $n$-bit signal. For ex., for a 16-bit signal, noise floor is at least $-(6.02*16+1.761) \\approx -98dB$.\n",

    "+ THD - Total harmonic distortion. When a sinusoid passes through an LTI system, the output is always be a sinusoid of the same frequency as that of the input, but possibly with a different amplitude. However, if a sinusoid passes through a non_LTI system, we cannot predict what what the output would look like. However if system is approximately LTI then it make sense to think that the output of a sinusoidal input will most contain the input's fundamental frequencies with the system imperfections introducing extra harmonics. THD (fundamental) for a given sinusoid is the ratio of total power in harmonics to that of the fundamental calculated using RMS levels of the fundamental and the harmonics as::\n",

Besides that, it isn't meaningful to use a single sinusoid's $THD_F$ as a measure of a system's non-linearity - Different companies follow different methods while measuring THD of their equipment (like microphone, headphones etc.). Some use a single referece frequency, some use a few evenly sampled across the bandwidth and so on. \n",

    "### Why increase sampling frequency by 4 times is same as having 1 extra bit in quantizer\n",
    "Quantization (A/D conversion) at a sample rate Fs and a certain number\n",
    "of bits N produces a total noise power Pn that is a function of N but not\n",
    "a function of Fs. So, for any given N, you get Pn watts of noise power\n",
    "no matter if the sample rate is 1 sample per second or 1E9 samples per\n",
    "second. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to understand is that the quantization noise power Pn\n",
    "is spread evenly across all frequencies in the digital signal. So if\n",
    "you're sampling at Fs samples per second, the noise will be Pn/(Fs/2)\n",
    "watts per Hertz. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if Pn is 1 watt and Fs is 2000 samples/second. Then there\n",
    "will be that Pn/(Fs/2) = 1 / 1000 = 0.001 watt/Hz of noise power in\n",
    "the frequency domain. So in a 1 Hz bandwidth you'd have 1 milliwatt;\n",
    "in a 10 Hz bandwidth you'd have 10 milliwatts; in the total bandwidth\n",
    "of 1000 Hz you'd have 1 watt.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now we get to the point of your question. Let's say your total\n",
    "signal power in the bandwidth of interest is Ps, the total noise power\n",
    "due to quantization is Pn, and the signal bandwidth is B Hz. If you\n",
    "sample at 2*B samples/second, then the amount of quantization noise\n",
    "power Pnb in the signal bandwidth B is\n",
    "\n",
    "  Pnb = B * (Pn / (Fs/2)) \n",
    "      = B * (Pn / B)\n",
    "      = Pn\n",
    "\n",
    "and the SNR is then\n",
    "\n",
    "  SNR = Ps / Pnb\n",
    "      = Ps / Pn\n",
    "\n",
    "So there's nothing you can do to improve the SNR. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you oversample by some amount, say, Fs = M*2*B samples\n",
    "per second, where M > 1, where B is the bandwidth of interest,\n",
    "then the amount of quantization noise power Pnb in the signal bandwidth B is\n",
    "\n",
    "  Pnb = B * (Pn / (Fs/2)) \n",
    "      = B * (Pn / M*B)\n",
    "      = Pn / M\n",
    "\n",
    "and the SNR is then\n",
    "\n",
    "  SNR = Ps / Pnb\n",
    "      = M * Ps / Pn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus you have improved your SNR by a factor of M. So, if M = 2, you\n",
    "improve the SNR by 3 dB; if M = 4, you improve the SNR by 6 dB (or\n",
    "1 bit); etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to answer your questions note the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. what is important is the SNR in the bandwidth of interest. \n",
    "  2. oversampling improves the SNR in the bandwidth of interest\n",
    "  3. decimation (assuming you prefilter with the appropriate\n",
    "  lowpass filter) does not destroy the SNR improvement in the\n",
    "  bandwidth of interest.\n",

    "### Quantizer noise\n",
    "Quantizer noise is basically the rounding error (or truncation error) resulting from the very operation of quantizing. Basically a quantizer can be modelled as a noise source that adds to the input signal to form the output signal. Quantization noise is correlated with the signal. Different types of signals produces different types of quantization noise. SQNR - Signal to Quantization Noise Ratio derived for one type of signal is, in general, not applicable to a different type of signal. But there are some facts about quantization noise that will be the same for all types of input signals as listed below\n",
    " + Rounding error can never be greater than $\\pm 1/2$ LSB. So if the quantizer noise is a random variable, its distribution, irrespecitve of whatever it may be, will always be bound. In other words, the noise cannot have a Gaussian distribution stretching from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$\n",
    " + Quantizer noise isn't frequency dependent\n",
    " + For a given signal, as quantizer number of bits increases, the quantization noise will decrease. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**When input signal is uniformaly distributed RV**: Suppose the signal is uniformly distributed from 0 volts to Vmax volts. Then the signal power, i.e., the variance, will be $\\dfrac{\\left(V_{max}-0\\right)^2}{12}$. The quantizer noise will also be uniformly distributed between $-\\dfrac{1}{2} \\dfrac{V_{max}}{2^n}$ volts and $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\dfrac{V_{max}}{2^n}$ volts, i.e, $Noise \\sim U\\left( -\\dfrac{V_{max}}{2^{n+1}}, \\dfrac{V_{max}}{2^{n+1}} \\right)$, where $n$ is the number of bits in the quantizer. Noise power, i.e., its variance, is hence, $\\dfrac{\\left(V_{max}/2^n\\right)^2}{12}$. So the SQNR is:\n",

    "**When input signal is a sine wave**: THe quantization noise for a sine wave looks like as shown below.

In this case, we will end up with more or less a saw tooth wave as shown below. \n",

    "### Dither\n",
    "When an analog signal is quantized, or when a digital signal is requantized to a lower resolution, the quantizer error is correlated with the signal and human ear perceives correlated noise as more irritating that even a higher level uncorrelated error. Dither added to the signal *before* quantization results in an uncorrelated noise that is more acceptable. One way to think about dither is that, if you round a value 4.8, it always results in 5. However, if we add a uniform noise (-0.5, 0.4), the signal level 4.8 gets converted into a uniform R.V. varying between 4.3 and 5.3. This means that, 20% of times (when after dither it is 4.3, 4.4), the original value of 4.8 will be quantized to 4, and 80% of times (when after dither it is 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5, 5.1, 5.2) to 5. If we average 20% of 4s and 80% of 5s, we get 4.8. So if the input signal is a sine wave, if one were to take the quantizer output and superimpose several periods, and average the result, it will look like a smooth sine wave, instead of a quantized step-like sine wave. The averaging happens inside the human ear. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of dither applies to signals of all dimensions. In fact, it is easier to see its use when it comes to images. For example, there is a grayscale image that needs to be requantized to just two values - white and black - then  regular quantization will result in large washed out areas and large areas moved to black as shown below:\n",
