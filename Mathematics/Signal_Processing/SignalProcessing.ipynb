    "Quantizer noise is basically the rounding error (or truncation error) resulting from the very operation of quantizing. Basically a quantizer can be modelled as a noise source that adds to the input signal to form the output signal. Quantization noise is correlated with the signal. Different types of signals produces different types of quantization noise.

But there are some facts about quantization noise that will be the same for all types of input signals as listed below\n",

    "### Dither\n",
    "When an analog signal is quantized, or when a digital signal is requantized to a lower resolution, the quantizer error is correlated with the signal and human ear perceives correlated noise as more irritating that even a higher level uncorrelated error. Dither added to the signal *before* quantization results in an uncorrelated noise that is more acceptable. One way to think about dither is that, if you round a value 4.8, it always results in 5. However, if we add a uniform noise (-0.5, 0.4), the signal level 4.8 gets converted into a uniform R.V. varying between 4.3 and 5.3. This means that, 20% of times (when after dither it is 4.3, 4.4), the original value of 4.8 will be quantized to 4, and 80% of times (when after dither it is 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5, 5.1, 5.2) to 5. If we average 20% of 4s and 80% of 5s, we get 4.8. So if the input signal is a sine wave, if one were to take the quantizer output and superimpose several periods, and average the result, it will look like a smooth sine wave, instead of a quantized step-like sine wave. The averaging happens inside the human ear. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of dither applies to signals of all dimensions. In fact, it is easier to see its use when it comes to images. For example, there is a grayscale image that needs to be requantized to just two values - white and black - then  regular quantization will result in large washed out areas and large areas moved to black as shown below:\n",

    "+ In nyquist rate converters, the analog signal is filtered through an (analog) anti-aliasing filter, a sample and hold circuit and then a multi-level quantizer. The problem is, the anti-aliasing filter needs to have a sharp rolloff and is often implemented with non-linear phase response. The non-linear phase distortion degrades quality of the output. Also the multi-level quantizer needs to have several reference voltages (as many as the no. of levels) which is complex and hard to fabricate\n",
    "+ We have seen that, in the case of the quantizer noise being a uniform random variable, the noise RMS is $\\dfrac{q}{\\sqrt{12}}$. That makes the power to be $\\dfrac{q^2}{12}$. Since the power is spread out evenly over the entire band, the power spectral density is flat (white) with an amplitude of be $\\dfrac{q^2}{12f_s}$, where $f_s$ is the sampling frequency. When we use oversampling, there is a straight-forward reduction of noise power by OSR times in the band of interest. So if the OSR is 4, then noise power reduces by 4.\n",
    "+ The other advantage of using an OSR is that, unlike in the case of the nyquist rate converters, the (analog) anti-aliasing filter need not have a sharp-rolloff. This is because, as long as the roll-off is such that, when sampled at $f_s*OSR$, the aliasing stops before the edge of the passband .

    "The second implementation is more efficient as it uses only one filter. Since earlier this filter was in the loop, it is called the \"loop filter\". The simplest loop filter is an integrator. Thus in that case, a difference operator comes first followed by an integrator. It is hence called a **\"Delta-Sigma converter**. If the quantizer is a 1-bit quantizer, then the noise-shaper above becomes a PCM to PDM converter!\n",
    "\n",
    "A few points of importance:\n",
    "  + Noise cannot be suppressed over the entire band or even a large band as described [here](https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Noise_shaping) and [here](https://www.dsprelated.com/showarticle/184.php). Apparently there is something called rate-distortion and limitation is proven by Gerzon-Craven noise-shaping theorem. There is also some other advanced shit in the second link. \n",
    "  + To make noise shaping meaningful, one must use dither - otherwise the quantization noise levels won't be uniform throughout the band and hence it would be unpredictable what the noise shaping will achieve. Without dither, the quantization noise will depend heavily on the signal and hence its spectrum unpredictable. So it will look something like this (don't worry about other blocks):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=noise_shaping_dither.png width=800 />\n",
    "  \n",
    "  + Typically the input is over-sampled at some OSR, and then (we get $x[n]$ above, and) the whole process of noise shaping as described above is done. After the noise shaping (i.e., after we get $y[n]$), an anti-aliasing (digital) filter is applied and decimation is carried out. In the case of a PCM-to-PDM converter, the sigma-delta modulation is done at the transmitter and the resulting binary (analog) signal is sent out. At the receiver, a simple LPF (even an RC filter with poor rolloff) can be used because of the OSR and the resulting analog signal can directly be fed to a speaker or to an ADC to convert back to PCM. PWM is closely related to PDM (probably exactly the same...need to check).\n",
    "      + The idea of combining OSR with dither makes easier sense if we think in terms of images: First resample images with higher number of pixels (a rectangular group of pixes will how have the same value as a single pixel in the original image), then add dither and quantize (Check github dsp/tutorial/dither_image.py \n",
    " + Sometimes, to explicitly show that the noise shaping process is causal, the filter is divided into a $z^{-1}$ (delay element) and the remaining is shown as a transfer function $H(Z)$. \n"
