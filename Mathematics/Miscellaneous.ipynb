    "# Gradient Descent\n",
    "A 3D surface can be modeled as a function that changes value based on $x$ and $y$ value. The function's value can be plotted on the z-axis. When we take the gradient of that surface at a certain $(x,y)$ point, we are essentially drawing a plane tangential to the surface at $(x,y)$ and measuring it's slope, which is a 2D vector with an $x$ and a $y$ component. Such a plane would have the following form:\n",

    "z(x,y) = -\\dfrac{a}{c}-\\dfrac{b}{c}+\\dfrac{d}{c}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to find the direction of steepest descent or ascent, we can find the directional gradient of $z$ in all directions and choose the one that maximizes it. To find the directional gradient of $z$, we should parameterize the incremental values of $x$, $y$, i.e., $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ in terms of the direction $\\theta$ as:\n",

    "where, $0<\\mu<<1$ is a very small step. What we achieve with this parameterisation is that we eliminate the dependence of the gradient result on differences in the magnitude of the step (by keeping steps in all directions equal to the same value, i.e., $\\mu$). \n",
    "\n",
    "The directional gradient along a vector $\\mathbf{v}$ can be calculated as:\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\dfrac{d}{d\\mathbf{v}} z &= \\dfrac{z(x + \\Delta x, y + \\Delta y) - z(x,y)}{\\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^2 + (\\Delta y)^2}} \\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last step above, we are recognising the fact that the gradient is a function of $\\theta$. Our job is to find the extremum of this function with respect to $\\theta$. To find the extremum of any function, we should differentiate it and equate to zero:\n",

    "i.e., the directional gradient achieves the max value when the slope of the direction vector on the $xy$ plane is $\\dfrac{b}{a}$. But we realize, by taking partial derivates of the tangential plane on $x$ and $y$ axis that,\n",

    "This is why, gradient is the direction of the steepest descent. Intuitively, one can think of this operation as shifting the tangential plane so that $x,y$ get translated to the origin and then we draw a circle of radius $\\mu$ on the $xy$ plane, project it on the translated plane surface. The result will be an ellipse on the plane. The major axes would point in the direction of maximum ascent/descent, and the minor axes would point in the direction in which $z$ doesn't change. So the corollary of the theorem that the gradient always points in the direction of the steepest ascent/descent is that, the gradient is always perpendicular to the contour lines of the 3D surface at all points of the countour - This is because, by definition, contour lines represent the path along which $z$ doesn't change and since the minor axes of the afore mentioned ellipse is always perpendicular to the major axes, the gradient is always perpendicular to the contour lines. This fact is crucial in understanding Lagrange multiplier based constrained optimisation.\n",
