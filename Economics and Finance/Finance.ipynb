    "# Basics\n",
    "## General\n",
    "- Any asset that can be traded is a security\n",
    "- Equity and Debt are two types of securities\n",
    "- Preferred and common stocks are two types of equity\n",
    "    - Preferred stock owners do not get voting rights, have a senior claim to the company's assets/earnings, and are usually promised a fixed dividend for perpetuity\n",
    "- Individuals borrow money through personal loans, mortgage loans, credit cards, construction loans, construction loans, and so on, from retail banks. The formal term for debt related to individuals is **Personal Debt**\n",
    "- Institutions (corporations, organizations, governments) can borrow from commercial banks or issue bonds. This is called **Corporate Debt**\n",
    "    - Debt has seniority over equity (preferred/common)\n",
    "- Securities made of debt assets are called **Fixed Income Securities**\n",
    "- Markets\n",
    "    - **Capital markets**: Stocks and Bonds (securities with maturities > 1 year to $\\infty$)\n",
    "    - Commodity markets: Trading oranges, metals etc.\n",
    "    - **Money markets**: Short term debt financing (securities with maturies < 1 year)\n",
    "    - **Derivatives market**: \n",
    "        - Futures market: Forward contracts\n",
    "        - Options\n",
    "    - Forex market\n",
    "    - Cryptocurrency market\n",
    "    - The term \"Spot market\" implies trading exchange is done on the spot as opposed to futures\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Ecosystem\n",
    "- Individuals and institutions investing and borrowing money\n",
    "    - Mutual funds, hedge funds pool funds and invest them\n",
    "    - Pension, endowment funds either invest directly of through companies offering investment services\n",
    "    - Trading arms of reail banks, commercial banks, insurance companies\n",
    "- Retail banks lending money to individuals/households\n",
    "- Commercial banks lending money to institutions\n",
    "- Investment banks providing services such as **underwriting** (IPO), M&A, risk analysis, financial advise etc.\n",
    "- Brokerage firms enabling retail investors to trade securities\n",
    "- Exchanges (Ex. NYSE, BSE), Alternative Trading Systems (**ATS**) (Multilateral trading facilities in Europe) facilitating the exchange of securities and money\n",
    "    - Electonic Communication Networks (**ECN**) are part of ATS\n",
    "    - Large players use Dark pools, ATS to avoid driving down prices while a large exchange happens\n",
    "    - They are sometimes called **Dark Pools** because of lack of transparency about the price fo exchanges\n",
    "- Auditing companies (Ex. E&Y, Deloitte, PWC, KPMG)\n",
    "- Insurance companies (Ex. AIG)\n",
    "- **Clearing houses** intermediating between buyer and seller to reduce couter-party risk ensuring parties honour contractual obligations in options, futures trading\n",
    "- Rating and research agencies (Ex. S&P, Moody's, Fitch, SIFMA, IBES, Value line)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "- **NBFC/NBFI**: Non-banking Fiancial Institutions. Ex. Insurance companies, pawn shops, currency exchanges, payday lending companies\n",
    "- **HFT**: High Frequency Trading. Algorithmic trading done by computers\n",
    "- **Market Makers**: Traders, who are part of some institution, who bid and sell at the same time.\n",
    "- **OTC**: Over The Counter - Exchanging of stocks not traded on exchanges through broker-dealer networks\n",
    "- Leverage: Ratio of own investment to total investment. Ex. If one invests \\\\$100K in a house worth \\\\$500K (by borrowing \\\\$400K from a bank), then one is said to be leveraged 5 to 1. If the house price falls by 20%, i.e., to \\\\$400K, then loss to oneself is 5x of that, i.e., 100%, as one will have to pay the bank \\\\$400K no matter how the price fluctuates. In other words, one's investment amount will be completely wiped out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary market\n",
    "Primary market is where securities are created. For ex., when a company does an IPO, investors directly put money into the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"financing/primary_market.webp\" width=800/> \n",
    "\n",
    "- Corporations: Apple, Exxon, Google, GE etc.\n",
    "- Institutions: Bridgewater associates, Blackstone, KKR, The Carlyle group, Apollo global management\n",
    "- Investment Banks: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Morgan Stanley\n",
    "- Public accounting firms: Deloitte, PWC, E&Y, KPMG, Grant Thornton\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary market\n",
    "Secondary market is where securities are traded between investors. So a company doesn't get any money when its securities are traded in the secondary market\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"financing/secondary_market.webp\" width=800/> \n",
    "\n",
    "## Personal Debt:\n",
    "- Mortgage loans, home equity loans, personal loans, credit card loans etc. do not require the borrower to spend it for a specific purpose. Car loans, construction loans, student loans etc., require the borrower to spend it for an intended purpose (because the banks measured risk based on that purpose). \n",
    "- Mortgage Backed Securities (**MBS**) bundle mortgage loans and often create **tranches** such as senior, mezzanine, junior, equity grades. They usually create MBS's with mortgages from all over the country to reduce risk by creating diversity \n",
    "- Asset Backed Securities (**ABS**) bundle non mortgage loans such as credit card loans, car loans etc.\n",
    "- Collateralized Debt Obligations (**CDO**) combine various MBS, ABS, layer them into tranches of varying seniority (priority of payments in case of defaults).\n",
    "- Individual's credit score is given by **FICO** scores in the U.S. A security's credit rating is given by rating agencies. In the U.S., it is the \"big 3\" namely, S&P, Moody's and Fitch\n",
    "- Home mortgage loans, Home equity loans (a.k.a second mortgage) are made only against fully constructed/freehold properties. Construction loans are given to under construction properties. If someone mentions \"Home Loan\" without mentioning mortgage or equity, it means a constuction loan\n",
    "- **Fixed-rate Mortgages** mean a constant (minimum) EMI payment for the entire lifetime of the loan. **Adjustable-rate Mortgages** mean that the rate is fixed at a low level for few payments and then some variable rate kicks in after that. There are many other types of mortgages\n",
    "    - The variable rate in adjustable rate mortgages is based on benchmarks such as **LIBOR** (London Inter-Bnk Offered Rate), COFI (11th district Cost of Funds Index), MTA (Monthly Treasury Average)\n",
    "- **Home Equity** is the proportion of down payments plus loan amount paid to the total value of the property\n",
    "- **Home Equity Loan** is a loan borrowed against the houseowner's equity. **HELOC** is a type of home equity loan\n",
    "- Default on mortgage loans will lead to **foreclosure** wherein the lender will force the sale of the asset to recoup the remaining loan amount. Default doesn't just mean missing periodic payments, but include not paying property tax, insurance premiums etc. When a foreclosure sale happens (usually through auction), the sale proceeds are used to first pay off the lender of the mortgage loan. Any remaining amount will then go to junior liens, such as second mortgages, if any. And if money still remains, the borrower will get it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Corporate Debt\n",
    "- Can be bank loans, commerical paper (short term), corporate notes (medium term) or corporate bonds (long term).\n",
    "    - Other than bank loan, the rest are securities directly issued by the company to investors and traded on the secondary market. Commerical paper trades on money market as it is short term. \n",
    "    - Corporate loans themselves can be securitised, (but not by the company issuing debt)\n",
    "- Bank loans can be bilateral (one bank to a company) or syndicate loans (syndicate of banks to a company). Most bank loans to corporations are floating-rate loans based on **LIBOR**, **SOFR** or sovereign or prime rate\n",
    "- Bank loans can be bullet loans or amortizing. Bullet means either the entire principal with interests is paid at the end or just the interests are paid periodically and the principal is paid at the end (like coupon bonds). Amortizing loans require fixed periodic payments over the lifetime of the loan\n",
    "    - Corporation that have bullet loans where principal needs to be paid at the end, pay interests periodically with their cash, but do not pay the principal at the end with their cash - They just take another such bullet loan and use it to pay off the principal and continue paying interests on the new loan.\n",
    "- Corporate bonds can be coupon, discount, annuities or perpetuities. Coupon bonds can have fixed coupons or floating coupons based on some floating rate\n",
    "- Some bonds come with embedded options such as callable, puttable and convertible. \n",
    "    - Callable means the issuer (corporation raising debt) can payoff prematurely and retire the bond\n",
    "    - Puttable means the holder (investor buying the bond) can sell the bond back to the issuer (if price falls)\n",
    "    - Convertible means the bond can be converted to equity\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Stocks\n",
    "- **ETF** - Exchange Traded Funds. They are a collection of stocks that are tradable as a security in exchanges\n",
    "- **Index funds** are mutual funds but invest in stocks that are part of an index such as S&P 500 \n",
    "\n",
    "## Rates\n",
    "### APR \n",
    "Annual Percentage Rate is the most commonly mentioned rate for loans. Most loans have interests compounding at a particular frequency, a.k.a. compounding rate. APR is a convenient method for calculating the growth of the loan amount over any period of time. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Loan\\ Balance = P*\\left(1 + \\frac{APR}{CF} \\right)^{T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $CF$ is the compounding frequency (times/year), and $T$ No of periods based on the compounding frequency. For example, if we borrow a mortgage loan for \\\\$100,000 at a rate of 5% APR and its compounding frequency is monthly, then, at the end of 3 months, the balance we owe to the bank would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Loan\\ Balance = \\$100,000*\\left( 1 + \\frac{5}{12} \\right)^3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, APR is divided by 12 because there are 12 months in a year. If the compounding frequency is daily, then, assuming there are 91 days in 3 months, we would have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Loan\\ Balance = \\$100,000*\\left( 1 + \\frac{5}{365} \\right)^{91}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever someone bluntly mentions \"rate\", it is most likely to be an APR. The compounding frequencies for different loan instruments may differ - In USA, most mortgage loans compound monthly, whereas most savings account balances compound daily. And this varies from one country to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note about APRs is that, even if someone makes a mistake in the compounding frequency, it may not distort the balance amount all that much as long as the APR is small (say less than 10%). For example, when the APR is 10%, if the compounding frequency is daily, then \n",
    "the overall return (if one had invested in that debt instrument) in 1 year would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "return = \\left( 1 + \\frac{0.1}{365} \\right)^{365} = 10.51\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But if someone made the mistake of assuming that the compounding was happening monthly, then he will calculate\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "return = \\left( 1 + \\frac{0.1}{12} \\right)^{12} = 10.47\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The wrong return is only 4 basis points away from the correct one. \n",
    "\n",
    "### EAR \n",
    "Effective Annual Rate gives as the annual rate of return on a debt instrument. It can be calculated from APR as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "EAR = \\left( 1 + \\frac{APR}{CF} \\right)^{CF} - 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the compounding is monthly, then $ EAR = (1 + APR/12)^{12} - 1 $, and if it is daily, then $EAR = (1 + APR/365)^{365} - 1 $ and so on. There is something called continuous compounding wherein the interest rate compounds every instance. In this case the EAR turns out to be an interesting formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "EAR = \\lim_{CF \\to \\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{APR}{CF} \\right)^{CF} - 1\\ =\\ e^{APR} - 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### YTM\n",
    "Yield to maturity is the annual compounding rate that will explain the price of a bond, a.k.a. the present value (PV) of the bond. For example, if a coupon bond pays \\\\$C every year for M years and, on the M*th* year pays a FV of \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "PV = \\frac{C}{1+YTM} + \\frac{C}{(1+YTM)^2} + \\ldots + \\frac{C}{(1+YTM)^M} + \\frac{FV}{(1+YTM)^M}  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very common for bonds to pay coupons on a semi-annual basis. In this case, YTM is calculated like an APR. For ex., a bond in the U.S. that has a coupon rate of 4% and an FV of \\\\$1000 and a maturity of 5 years pays \\\\$20 every six months. In this case, YTM is calculated based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "PV = \\frac{C/2}{1+\\frac{YTM}{2}} + \\frac{C/2}{\\left(1+\\frac{YTM}{2}\\right)^2} + \\ldots + \\frac{C/2}{\\left(1+\\frac{YTM}{2}\\right)^{2M}} + \\frac{FV}{\\left(1+\\frac{YTM}{2}\\right)^{2M}}  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, C = \\\\$40. Calculating YTM from the above formulae requires finding the roots of a M*th* or 2M*th* order polynomial. Normally numerical methods are used. But if one wants to use a calculator, one can use second order approximation based solution as given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "YTM \\approx \\dfrac{C + \\dfrac{FV-PV}{M}}{\\dfrac{FV+PV}{2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is for the case of yearly coupon payments. If it is semi-yearly, the formula is the same because,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\dfrac{YTM}{2} &\\approx \\dfrac{\\dfrac{C}{2} + \\dfrac{FV-PV}{2M}}{\\dfrac{FV+PV}{2}} \\\\\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "YTM &\\approx \\dfrac{C + \\dfrac{FV-PV}{M}}{\\dfrac{FV+PV}{2}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The approximate YTM formula can be used to obtain a seed for the numerical method used to calculate a more accurate YTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other rates\n",
    "**APY** (Annual Percentage Yield) is nothing but EAR. **BEY** (Bond Effective Yield) is APR for bonds that mature in less than a year. It is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "BEY = \\dfrac{FV-PV}{PV} * \\dfrac{365}{days}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\"days\" in the above formula is no. of days till maturity. Example: A three month treasury bill of a face value of \\\\$100 and PV of \\\\$95 will give a return of 5% in 3 months. BEY, hence, would be 20% because one year has four 3-months. Thus BEY is an APR. Since bonds are traded after initial issue, maturity at purchase time can be odd figures like 82 days, 35 days etc. This is why BEY formula uses maturity days instead of maturity months as the granularity period. One can calculate EAR from BEY using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "EAR = \\left[ 1 + \\dfrac{BEY}{\\left(\\dfrac{365}{days}\\right)} \\right]^{\\left(\\dfrac{365}{days}\\right)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "# Risk Vs. Return\n",
    "Why would anyone invest money instead of keeping the money at home in a safe? it is because we want to grow our money. Why do we want to grow our money? There is a need and greed to do so - The need is that, inflation will render our money less valuable in the future. So we have to grow our money at least as much as inflation devalues our money. The greed is self explanatory. In this section, our entire focus will be on how much growth one expects from an investment - We will start with the simplest of markets, where there is only one security in which we can invest, and introduce more and more securities to see how our decision would change in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single risk-free bond\n",
    "Suppose the market only has one security - it is a riskless government bond, which offers \\\\$1 after one year. How much should we pay for this bond? Suppose inflation rate is 2\\% yearly. Then it makes sense that, at a minimum, if we stick \\\\$x into a risk-free bond, we should at least get \\\\$x\\*1.02. The reason is, if it doesn't pay at least this much, we would just buy all the non-perishable items in the CPI basket with \\\\$x and keep it home and sell them after 1 year and make \\\\$x\\*(1.02). So if the bond face value is \\\\$1, then we cannot pay more than $ \\frac{\\$1}{1.02} = 0.9803*\\$1 = \\$0.9803 $. The multiplicative factor 0.9803 in the above calculation is called the **discount factor** - It is the factor by which we discount a future dollar. One can think of it as a way of converting a future dollar into today's dollar (just like we would use a conversion factor to go between two different currencies). If we want to converse in terms of the denominator, the value in excess of 1 is called the **rate of return** or simply **return** - i.e., \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "r &= \\dfrac{\\$1}{\\$0.9803} - 1 = \\dfrac{\\$1 - \\$0.9803}{\\$0.9803}\n",

    "## One risk-free bond and one risky bond\n",
    "Now, let us say that we have a choice between a riskfree government bond and a corporate bond that is risky - risky in that, there is a chance of default. Let us say that on a \\\\$1 investment in this bond, there is a 50\\% chance of default where we get \\\\$0 in return after one year and a 50\\% chance that we will get \\\\$2x. This means the expected value of this investment is $ 0.5*\\$0 + 0.5*\\$2x = \\$x $. The question is what should be the value of \\\\$x that will make us invest in the corporate bond instead of the riskfree government bond? Since \\\\$1 invested in a government bond will give us \\\\$1.02, \\\\$x must be greater than \\\\$1.02. How much greater? The answer is entirely a personal choice - And hence it will vary from one person to another. Let us call the return from this risky bond as $ R_i $. Suppose we call the risk free return of the government bond, $ r_f $, we have: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E[R_i] = r_f + risk\\ premium $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "where, the risk premium is the excess return on top of riskless return that we need in order to invest in the corporate bond\n",
    "\n",
    "In the wake of that question, we can make the following additional observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probabilty of default is a prediction. And the prediction may be right or wrong. So the risk premium must contain within it, an uncertainty premium \\- because there is any uncertainty involved at all as compared to a risk-free bond \\- and also a prediction premium because we are taking a risk in making a prediction of the probabilities. In other words, there is a probability that your probability estimates are wrong\n",
    "- Other people in the market may estimate the chances of default differently than us, besides the fact that they may demand a different risk premium than we do. \n",
    "- The price of a security, whether or not it is risky, will depend entirely upon supply-demand. So the price may be higher than what we demand or lower. Even though the prices are fixed by the market, our decision to invest or not should depend only on our appetite for taking risks and the returns that we want. There isn't really such a thing as a ``fair price'' for a security. \n",
    "- The predictions about chances of default can be made only with available data - i.e., present and past data. We cannot predict based on future data\n",
    "    \n",
    "An important note before we move on: So far, we have considered government bonds to be risk free. But the truth is, the risk free return is a misnomer because it is just a rate the market collectively demanded as something greater than the rate of inflation - And the rate of inflation itself is a prediction (although very accurate). This is the reason why the price of government bonds (which is a function of only r_f, as the cash flows are constants) varies from time to time. If it was truly risk free, that wouldn't be the case!\n",
    "\n",
    "## One risk-free bond and two risky bonds\n",
    "Suppose we have two bonds, A and B, such that, A will pay \\\\$2 or \\\\$0, each with a probability of 0.5, while B will pay \\\\$1.5 or \\\\$0.5, each with a probability of 0.5. Both bond A and bond B have the same expected payoff, but are otherwise different in their payoff-probability structure. Would we pay the same price for both bonds? It doesn't sound right to pay the same price for both bonds. Now consider another scenario: bonds A and B have the same payoffs, namely \\\\$2 or \\\\$0, but with different probabilities - would we pay the same price for both? Again, it doesn't sound right to do so. In this section, we will develop a way to quantify risk and a way to compute the fair price for A given the price for B or vice-versa: Note that, we are going to come up a comparative pricing model, not an absolute pricing model - We are arguing that, while how much to pay for a given risk level may be a personal preference, once the preference is set, how one values two risky assets has to be consistent. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our examples of risky bonds, we have considered, so far, only two payoff possibilities - one when there is a default and one when there isn't - i.e., the bond payoffs are a Bernoulli random variable. In reality, it will be a much more complex random variable with several payoff possibilities and probabilities associated with them. There are many reasons for this:\n",
    "1. The payoff when the company defaults isn't going to be a single value. When a default happens, creditors take control of the company and liquidate assets. Then depending on whether the bond is serior or junior, we will get a payoff proportional to our debt ownership within our bond category. So when we predict this payoff, we can think of several possible scenarios each of which will mean different payoffs for us - And these scenarios will all come with their own probabilities\n",
    "2. The payoff need not always come from the company that issued the bond. If the bond is a security, it can be traded in the market for a higher price that what we got it for. But this means thinking about several kinds of risks starting with market risk, all of which can affect the price of the bond - and hence the returns - in different ways\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these reasons, even if the bond is indeed a Bernoulli random variable, the only way to meaningfully talk about expected payoffs and returns is if we were to make several observations of this bond - i.e., we toss the coin enough times for the idea of probabilistic outcomes to make sense. So, for any probability based analysis of these bond to make sense, we have to buy the same bond, year-after-year, for many many years and then take a sample average of their returns. As we know from the central limit theorem, we will end up with normal random variables for the average return of both bonds - So we will have to deal with a random variable that has various payoff possibilites and associated probabilities than the simple case of Bernoulli random variables. In this section, for the sake of deriving a meaningful risk vs. return criterion, we will consider the bonds' payoffs as normal random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say, bond A's payoff is $ \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_A,\\sigma^2_A) $ and bond B's payoff is $ \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_B,\\sigma^2_B) $. To come up with a comparitive pricing model, we need a criterion: Let us say our criterion is that, **we want to be 75\\% confident that the payoff isn't less than a target return**. Let us call this target return as $r_t$. If the price of bond A is $P_A$, then our criterion translates to the payoff of bond A being greater than or equal to $P_A(1+r_t)$ with a probability of 0.75 and the payoff of bond B being greater than or equal to $P_B(1+r_t)$ with a probability of 0.75. For notational convenience, let us call $P_A(1+r_t)$ as $T_A$ and $P_B(1+r_t)$ as $T_B$. Then our criterion can be mathematically written as:\n",

In other words, it is easy to get negetaive beta, but very difficult to get negative beta with positive expected return. In fact, if one such a security were to exist, then everyone would jump at it and its returns would come close to zero and its beta would also become less negative. Securities association with gold mining companies trade close to zero beta, sometimes going slightly negative. The are the closest securities get to negative beta.

So if the margin call is for \\\\$2000, if you don't want to deposit \\\\$2000 in cash, and decide to deposit shares, you may have to buy \\\\2000/(1-MMR) worth of shares and deposit that. \n",

    "+ Instead of depositing cash to meet your collateral requirements, if you decide to liquidate some of your assets to meet the margin requiremens, then the amount diluted, say, x will reduce the asset by x and since you are paying off the debt with that amount, reduce debt by x as well.

    "<img src=\"financing/MBS_issuances.png\" width=800/>\n",
    "+ Fed kept interest rates low after the 2001 crash for too long. This created easy credit\n",
    "+ FOMO created surge in the prices of MBS which caused even more demand for MBS. \n",
    "+ Securitization increased liquidity of loans. Banks found it easy to flip freshly issued mortgages off their balance sheets. This gave incentives to banks, brokers to increase the volume of loans issued without worrying about their quality. This fast tracked the bubble feedback loop\n",
    "+ Subprime mortgages, virtually non-existent before 2000 took off exponentially.Most sub-prime mortgages were ARMs\n",
    "+ Legal fraud started: \n",
    "    + Adjustable Rate Mortgages were issued to lure sub-prime buyers to get loans and buy homes\n",
    "    + Several MBS tranches, CDOs, CDSs were created to drown investors in financial terminology, create information asymmetry to hide    risks in underlying mortgages. \n",
    "    + Using complex computer models for creating tranches meant that investors who eventually held MBS/CDOs had no way to knowing how much risk they were taking. They became fully dependent on rating agencies\n",
    "    + Rating agencies didn't want to miss out on the service fee and were incentivised to give high credit ratings to bad MBS/CDOs.\n",
    "    + Insurance agencies, auditing agencies didn't want to miss out on the boom and all participated in creating false security in the minds of the investors\n",
    "\n",
    "**The feedback loop**\n",
    "+ Housing prices increase\n",
    "+ investors looking for low risk high return investments increase demand for MBS/CDOs\n",
    "+ More MBS/CDOs issued. They make mortgages liquid. Every smart guy along the chain flipped assets to make quick profits except for the loser (Retirement funds) who actually ended up holding the mortgages in their books. But they didn't care as the increasing housing prices reduced the risks. \n",
    "+ Banks created risky loans with teaser rates to fool people into buying houses that they can't afford\n",
    "\n",
    "**Euphoria**\n",
    "+ People started flipping houses as a way of making money\n",
    "+ Mortgage fraud increased\n",
    "+ Housing prices kept going up which meant that both the legal fraud and mortgage fraud went unnoticed. Investors stopped looking at fundamentals\n",
    "+ Increasing housing prices meant that existing house owners saw their Loan-To-Value (LTVs) decrease and hence were able to refinance. \n",
    "+ Existing house owners took Home Equity loans against the rising value of their property and fuelled consumption and increased inflation. This may have caused some job creation and even more demand for homes\n",
    "+ ARMs delayed deliquencies of EMI payments and defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "**Profit-Taking**\n",
    "+ Adjustable rates started kicking in and delinquencies and defaults started going up\n",
    "+ Foreclosures started. The smartest guys started offloading MBS/CDOs to unsuspecting buyers like retirement funds\n",
    "+ The demand for MBS/CDOs started going down and the feedback loop started working in the opposite way\n",
    "+ The smart guys found innovative ways to keep the image of boom going until they could offload risky assets off their books\n",
    "\n",
    "**Panic**\n",
    "+ In Q1, 2007, Case-Shiller index showed first year-on-year housing prices decline since 1991\n",
    "+ On Apr 2, 2007, New Century Financial, America's largest subprime lender filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy\n",
