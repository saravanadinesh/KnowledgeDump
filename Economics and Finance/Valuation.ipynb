    "# Asset\n",
    "+ An \"asset\" is anything that generates cash flows at any/several points in the future.\n",
    "+ An asset can be financed by the asset's \"owners\", a.k.a., equity holders, by either using their own money or by borrowing from a bank. i.e., Assets = Equity + Liabilities. So a balance sheet is nothing but assets on the left hand side and what financed those assets on the right hand side\n",
    "+ An asset is said to be operating if it generates a cashflow. Suppose you buy a car with the intention of using it as a taxi, it is an operating asset if you do use it as a taxi and generate revenue. If the car is sitting idle in the parking lot, it is a non-operating asset\n",
    "+ The value of an asset is the sum of all cashflows (discounted at the appropriate rates), it generates from now to forever in the future. i.e., it's present value. It's past does not matter. An asset itself doesn't have any value unless it generates cash flows. In the previous example, the car sitting in the parking lot was a non-operating asset. Although it has a market value, unless it is sold, it doesn't generate a cash flow, and hence, doesn't have a value. So a car that is going to be sitting in a parking lot forever has a present value of zero dollars, and a net present value (N.P.V.) of negative value\n",
    "+ An asset's value must be independent of how one uses it. For instance, the value of a house should be independent of whether you are going to live in it or rent it out. In fact, that is exactly how one can evaluate the objective value of the pleasure of owning a house - the opportunity cost of those pleasures is what you are giving up by having that pleasure - and it is the cashflows you could have got by renting out that house. \n",
    "    + Another way to think is, suppose you buy a house, say house A, and rent an equivalent house, house B. It means, you can collect \\\\$x per month as rent from house A and simply use to pay your rent - Since both houses are similar, the rents must be identical. In this case, from the point you purchase house A, you get to enjoy house B without spending one extra dollar more. So house B must have the same price as house A. The pleasure of enjoying house B can objectively be defined as the cash flow generated by house A discounted by appropriate rates. So it makes sense to always evaluate an asset's value from the point of view of cash flow it would generate, whether or not you are going to use to asset for a business or for personal use\n",
    "    + The above example can be twisted as saying that, if you want to evaluate house A, look at the cash flows you will be saving by living in house A - i.e., not paying rent on an equivalent house. So house A price must be equal to all the rent saved discounted by appropriate rates.\n",
    "    + There is a nuance related to comparing one living in one's property vs. renting it out to others - if a property is used for income generating activity (such as in the latter), in some countries, the property's owners can deduct depreciation from the rental income before it is taxed. \n",
    "+ The money spent on creating an asset is a \"capital expense\". The other type of expense is an operating expense. The easy way to judge if something is capex or opex, is to check whether it is going to generate cash. In other words, money spent as capital expense comes back to you (hopefully at a higher value), but money spent on an operating expense is forever lost.\n",
    "    - A house is a capex as it can generate cashflows from rent and then from an eventual sale. But minimum energy costs you have to pay, whether you are using it or not, the maintainence costs you have to spend whether you are using it or not, are all opex\n",
    "    - Educating expense are a capex - you expect to use the education to get a job and generate a cash flow from the salaries. Food is an operating expense - you will never recover anything from it. But a person needs food to operate. Hence it is called an operating expense. Operating expense is whatever is essential of keeping the asset operating - preventing it from becoming a non-operating asset\n",
    "    - COGS appear only if goods are created. OpEx is the expense that is independent of whether or not the goods are created. For example, if you are a copacker, electricity cost incurred when the machines are running - doing packaging - is part of COGS. Suppose you get no orders for a month, COGS will correspondingly be zero as you will simply switch the machines off. But just to keep the business operational, you have to spend a minimum amount to keep lights on at the front office, pay lobby person, phone bill, pay accounted to file IT returns etc. They will be part of OpEx.\n",
    "+ Most assets depreciate in value over time. A car purchased for use as a taxi, will be losing its value over time. This depreciation needs to be accounted as an operating expense. \n",
    "    - Right at the moment you purchase a car, your assets remain unchanged in value - only changed in form: What was earlier in the form of cash is now in the form of a car. But from that point on, the car's value starts depreciating and your asset value starts going down. If the car doesn't generate cashflows to makeup for the depreciation (or more than make up for it), then it means you have destroyed value. \n",
    "    - If you purchase a car at say Rs. 10 lakhs, and if you try to sell it a year from now, if you get Rs. 8 lakhs, it means the value of the car depreciated by Rs. 2 lakhs. You need to account that as an operating expense. Assets can decrease linearly (straight line depreciation), i.e., Rs. 2 lakhs every year, or non-linearly. Cars usually depreciate non-linearly. But most corporate assets are regarded as depreciating in a straight line\n",
    "+ Any capex accounted as opex over a period of time is said to be \"amortized\". Depreciation is one type of amortization. But usually the word \"amortizing\" is used while talking about capex that are not assets - Money spent buying a truck is \"depreciated\", whereas, license paid to operate the trucking company is \"amortized\". The basic process of depreciation and amortization are same. hence they are always referred to together \n",
    "+ The part of the assets remaining after subtracting liabilities is what belongs to the equity holders. The moneys borrowed to finance an asset is called \"leverage\". If, say, you buy a \\\\$500K house with $100K of your own money and \\\\$400K of banks money, then it is said to be a leveraged buyout or \"LBO\", and you are levered 5:1. This is because, if the value of the house appreciates to, say, \\\\$600K (after netting out interest expenses), then you would have made \\\\$200K, that is twice the money: You contributed only 1/5th or 20\\% for acquiring an asset, but made out a 5x profit of 100\\%. This is because the bank gets only \\\\$400K no matter how much the house appreciates. It is called \"leverage\" because it acts like a lever in physics. Leverage works the other way as well. If the house's market value reduces by 20\\% the equity holder loses 100\\% of his investment.\n",
    "+ Borrowing might make good sense if one can invest that money at the same risk level as the bank investing it is taking, while getting more returns than the bank interest rate. In other words, you have a talent/knowledge that the bank doesn't have - and you use this talent/knowledge to achieve returns that people, on an average, cannot achieve by taking the same amount of risk\n",
    "\n",
    "# Liabilities\n",
    "+ Debt doesn't necessarily mean short-term/long-term loans from a bank. A long-term lease on a building is also a debt. Debt has the following characteristics:\n",
    "    - It has contractual commitments\n",
    "    - It is tax deductible \n",
    "    - If contractual obligations are not met, some bad things (ex. foreclosure) happen\n",
    "+ Interest payments, in many countries, are tax deductible. So financing using debt is attractive from that angle\n",
    "+ Unlike individuals, most companies don't make regular payments (EMI) towards both the capital and interest. They pay only interests until the maturity date. And at the maturity date, they take another loan and pay off the old loans capital amount with the new loan, and then start paying interests towards the new loan. This is done to avoid extraordinary expenses in any given quarter\n",
    "\n",
    "# Income and expenses\n",
    "+ Revenue can go up because of one or more of the following reasons (mentioned here for product companies. But a analogue works for service companies too)\n",
    "    - More units sold\n",
    "    - Same units sold as before, but sold at higher prices. This is not in itself bad. This means that customers saw increased value in the product\n",
    "    - Inflation increased. In this case, the real revenue didn't go up - only the nominal revenue went up\n",
    "+ Gross income = Revenue - Cost of Sales (COGS). COGS is like the raw material needed to make a product. Gross income hence represents the value added by the product. If we add all the value additions, i.e., the gross incomes, of all the companies in a country, then it becomes the Gross Domestic Product. In other words, if companies in India, small and big, producing every imaginable good/service, were to merge together, then the Gross income of that super company would be the GDP of India. In that case, since, all the raw material coming from within India would be also be part of the company's value addition, it will be considered as part of the Gross Income. Only the raw materials coming from outside the country - in this case, outside the super company - will be considered as COGS. This is basically all the imports.\n",
    "+ One can broadly classify expenses into four types: Gross expenses (COGS), operational expenses (SG&A, office energy costs etc.), capital expenses (D&A) and financial expenses (interest expense)\n",
    "+ COGS is that expense that linearly increases with units sold. It is that expense is that directly associated with the production of goods. For ex., energy cost in running production machinery is COGS, but energy cost for the office building that houses marketing, sales teams is opex\n",
    "+ R&D expenses are treated as operating expenses for accounting purposes. But these are really capex. \n",
    "+ Net income could increase because:\n",
    "    - Revenue increased, which could mean the company now has more customers or the value of the company's goods/services has increase or both\n",
    "    - COGS decreased. This may be a cyclical thing which would hence be temporary. If, somehow, a new innovation has reduced COGS, this could be a permanent thing, which is very good for your company\n",
    "    - Company optimized opex. While this is good, the thing to remember is, the net income increase in this case doesn't mean the company is growing. It only became more efficient. In fact, it is possible that losing market share may be offset by temporary improvement in opex (say, by firing some staff), which may mask the company's problems in the short term, but exacerbate them in the long term\n",
    "    - Long term lease is often listed in the income statement as opex. But due to its nature, it is actually debt. So one should be careful with it\n",

That part is lost to the company. This changes the $PV$ calculations as now we have to mutliply every term in the summation by a $(1-rir)$ factor, where $rir$ is the reinvestment rate. So we get,\n",

So only when we are evaluating mature companies that have reached a stage where their growth is slower than the cost of capital. So what do we do for fast growing companies? The tweak used by the professor is that, we split the companies growth periods into two phases: Phase1, in which the company is growth at a fast rate $g1>r_c$ for the first few years and then $g2<r_c$ for all the years after that. He also allows for different reinvestment rates for the two phases. So we will get the following DCFs for the two phases:\n",

Although our result will be different, there are so many other variables that may be different from us and the professor - $N$ itself is subjective. So is $rir2$. One could argue that the cost of capital would be lower when the company is in phase 2, and so much more. Apart from all these, it is pretty unrealistic that the company will move over from phase 1 to phase 2 abruptly, or that there will only be two phases. So everything discussed above should be considered as laying conceptual foundations for DCF based valuation. The actual valuation would have to factor in firm specific characteristics and one may have to make many adjustments to the above DCF calculations to come up with a valuation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cashflows for valuation\n",
    "In equation $\\eqref{eq:PV}$, we mentioned cashflows and free cash flows. But what are they? In this section we explore this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a person starting a simple business - say, a typical Indian barber shop. Suppose the person uses his own money to buy a small property, buy chairs and other hair cutting, cleaning equipment - i.e., he didn't get any loan. Say he employs two barbers. He pays their salary, energy costs and for raw materials such as razon blades, shampoo etc. Assuming this is a profitable business, every year, after accounting for all expenses, income tax etc., there will be some money (net income) left. This is the cashflow to the company for that year. Now the owner may choose the following options, or combinations thereof:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep the cashflow in the company's bank account as cash\n",
    "2. Transfer it to his personal account. This is basically dividend.\n",
    "3. Reinvest the money to create new assets and grow the company (like increasing the no. of chairs, buying a nearby builing and expanding etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Free cash flow to the firm is essentially money flowing to the owners of the company - in this case, the owner of the company.  In the first case, free cash flow to the firm is equal to the net income. In the second case, it is again the net income - This is because the firm basically belongs to the owner and hence it makes no difference whether the money went to the firm or the owner. In the last case, it is 0. The idea here is that the reinvestment will create new assets and hence more cashflows in the future than otherwise. In reality, short of slowly running the company into the ground, there is no escaping from reinvesting: Every asset depreciates - the cushions in those chairs wear off, the vacuum cleaner and hair blower die slowly, the building slowly deteriorates and so on. Even if the owner isn't reinvesting, at least part of the cash flow, into creating new assets, he will have to reinvest to make up for the depreciation. For instance, at some point, the chair depreciate to scrap and he has to buy new chairs. Having said that, there is no point is reinvesting all the net income into the company forever. After some point, the owner has to benefit from all the reinvestments - he has to take out dividends. In fact, the economy itself may not allow continuous reinvestment and expansion - Even if the owner keeps opening more and more shops from the cashflow coming from existing ones, at some point, he will run out of hair to cut. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the realistic case, free cash flow to the firm is whatever is left of net income after some of it is reinvested. If we want to evaluate this business, we can use the most recent free cash flow thus computed into equation $\\eqref{eq:PV}$. Of course, we have lot of unknowns to compute before we can work out the equation. But before we figure out other unknowns, there is an important nuance about cashflows: We have considered a simple buinsess where there was only one equity owner and no creditors. But many businesses get loans to partially finance the assets. In such cases, ne can buy the entire company (all its assets) or just the equity. To understand this, think about buying a house: In the case where the counterparty had partially financed the house originally using a loan and is still holding some of it, you are buying the entire asset by paying some money to the equity owner and the rest to the bank. This is equivalent to buying the entire firm. Suppose, instead, you pay off just the equity owner his portion of the house value, and simply transfer the loan from his name to your name. This is equivalent to equivalent to just buying the equity in a company. When we buy stocks in a company, this is what we are buying - just (part of) the equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since buying stocks is what we are interested in, we need to calculate the value of the equity in the firm - We can either directly value the equity or value the entire firm, and then, at the end, subract out the liabilities to get the value of the equity. Both methods should theoretically yeild the same result. However, calculating free cashflows are different between the two approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ In the earlier example of a barber shop, there was only one owner and no creditors. In this case, value of the equity and the value of the entire firm are one and the same. So the cashflows used was net income minus reinvestment is appropriate for valuing the firm as well as just the equity\n",
    "+ But if the company has creditors, when valuing the entire firm, one cannot use net income as the base. This is because, if you buy the entire company, then it means you paid of the equity owner as well as the creditors. So although the company had interest payments going on before the purchase, there won't be any interests to pay after the purchase: It would be misleading to use net income as the base for valuation as it came after interest payments (and taxation). After the purchase, assuming the return on invested capital remained the same, the net income would resemble latest EBIT after tax is paid on it, i.e., EBIT(1-tax). Hence it makes more sense to use the most recent EBIT(1-tax) as the basis for the valuation. \n",
    "    + Note that EBIT contains, apart from operating income, extraordinary income aand other gains. So, while considering value of the company, operating income (with interests paid on it) may be a better indicator than EBIT\n",
    "    + Operating Income (1-tax) is called \"after-tax operating income\"\n",
    "+ If you want to evaluate the equity directly, then it does makes sense to use the latest net income as the basis for evaluation as this is the cash flow to you after you buy the equity, assuming ROIC remained the same.\n",
    "+ When evaluating the entire firm (with EBIT(1-tax) as basis), the free cash flow is called FCFF - Free Cash Flow to the Firm. So the $FCF$ in equation $\\eqref{eq:PV}$ is replaced by FCFF, and the precent value can be called $PVF$ - Present Value of the Firm. Similarly if you are valuing just the equity, then the $FCF$ should be replaced with $FCFE$ and $PV$ renamed $PVE$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nuances about free cashflows\n",
    "So far, our take on free cashflows is that it is either after-tax operating income or net income with reinvestment needs factored in. But we didn't mention how exactly to go about figuring out how much the firm actually reinvests - In other words, how to come up with free cashflows by looking at the fundamentals. There are some problems associated with that. Part of the issue is that accountants, while coming up with operating or net income factor in or out non-cashflows for accounting reasons which mask the true value of the operating or net income. Particularly,\n",
    "+ They factor in depreciation and amortisation of capital assets created in earlier periods for the purpose of getting tax relief on them. But these aren't actual cashflows out of the business during that period. So we need to add D&A expense back to our original cashflow calculation\n",
    "+ They do not show capital expenses made during the period in question as they amortise it in later periods. But these are actual cashflows going out. So they need to be subtracted from our original cashflow calculation. That also covers the reinvestment needs\n",
    "    + While considering capex, one should only consider capex to create operating assets. Capex spent on creating non-operating assets are basically like cash in the balance sheet, but in a different form. \n",
    "+ They use accrual accounting - It means they record, as \"accounts receivable\" in the balance sheet sale amounts right after the sale is done. They don't wait until the cash actually comes into the company. They other way around is also done - whenever purchases are made from vendors, they add the purchase amount to \"accounts payable\". Again, the cash hasn't yet gone out of the company. Operating and net income area calculated as if the moneys mentioned have already realised. To correct this, we need to subtract out accounts receivable from, add accounts payable to after-tax operating income or net income. The extra nuance here is that, there is a chance some of the accounts receivable/payable from earlier period may have been carried over. So we first need to net out the carry over items. \n",
    "+ If inventory increased compared to the last period, then cash went out of the company - but it doesn't appear in the income statement. So change in inventory must be subtracted from\n",
    "+ Working capital, defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Current assets include inventory and accounts receivable. Current liabilities include accounts payable. So, many just subtract out change in working capital from after-tax operating income/net income. But this may not be the right thing to do because:\n",
    "    1. Current assets also includes cash. \n",
    "    2. Current liabilities already include interest on debt, which we have already factored in\n",
    "+ Professor Damodaran uses the term change in \"non-cash, non-debt working capital\" in place of just the change in working capital to stress this point.\n",
    "+ Whhile evaulating FCFE alone, principal payments made to creditors need to be subtract out as these are cash flowing out of the equity owners. If principal payments are subtracted out, then new debts issued must be added to the calculation. \n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "Note: In the professor's equations, he uses EBIT(1-t) in place of operating income(1-t) in his equations. This is probably because he is looking at the cleaned up fundamentals: He is cleaning up for R&D, leases as mentioned earlier, and normalises earnings. \"Normalising\" means taking into account the possibility, in case of cyclical companies or black swan events, that the most recent fundamentals may not represent typical fundamentals and using instead a normalised - i.e., smoothened version that is more typical. All the above are applicable to net income in his formulae as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important point about free cashflow based evaluation is that it can be used only to value operating equity, if using FCFE, or operating assets, while using FCFF. So at every step of the process, we need to ensure that non-operating assets aren't accidentally counted in. For example, while calculating reinvestment rate, we make sure that we don't count in cash in the working capital in the numerator. And, in the denominator, in case non-operating assets had generated some income, that needs to be subtracted from the net income (FCFE) or post tax operating income in the denominator. Example of income from non-operating assets is savings interest on cash if it is in a savings account or coupons from government bonds etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we count out non-operating assets, they have to be valued differently - say at their market price today - and added to the $PV$ coming out of DCF. For ex., if the firm has cash, it can simply be added. If it has government securities, the market value of those government securities can be added. If it is a fixed asset - like a building - then one has to figure out what the market value of that building is using real estate data.  \n",

    "## Estimating growth\n",
    "While valuing the firm, we want to find out the expected growth of after-tax operating income, and, while valuing the equity, the growth in net income. Growth comes from how much is reinvested, and how much return do we get out of that reinvestment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For firm valuation:\n",

    "+ The operating and net incomes above are corrected (for misrepresentations involving R&D, leases etc.) and normalised figures\n",
    "+ Book value of capital/equity is used instead of market value because book value represents the actual amount that is invested\n",
    "+ ROC/ROE are considered constants for the phase for which growth is estimated. This needs to be carefully evaluated before use\n",
    "+ Just as when we calculated reinvestment rates, if the firm has non-operating assets, then they need to be kept out of return on equity/assets as well. So in the numerator, income from non-operating assets must be netted out in the numerator. And in the denominator, BV of non-operating assets must be netted out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other factors for valuation\n",
    "+ While evaluating the entire firm, the cost of capital $r_c$ in equation $\\eqref{eq:PV}$ is the weighted sum of the cost of debt and the cost of equity. The professor chooses weights based on the market values of the debt and equities in that firm.\n",
    "+ While calculating bottom up $\\beta$, professor looks at industry average, unlevers that $\\beta$ with average industry leverage and the relevers it using the leverage of the firm in question. Additionally, he \"cleans up\" the $\\beta$ for cash. What he is doing is following the principle of keeping our non-operating assets from our DCF calculations. In fact, throughout the book, there are inconsistencies when he tries to keep out non-operating assets - sometimes, he nets out only cash, at other, cash and marketable securities, and in a video on youtube, he mentions, while talking about reinvestment, he mentions that only reinvestments into operating assets should be considered. Overall idea is that, while valuing a firm, non-operating assets and their incomes need to be kept out as they have nothing to do with what the company does for a living. \n",
    "+ Professor asserts that $g2$ cannot be faster than the economy it is operating in.\n",
    "+ Compared to phase 1 of $PV$ calculation, almost all fundamentals in phase 2 will be different. This is because we are assuming that, in phase 1, the company is a growing company, and in phase 2, it is a mature company. A stable growth company, as compared to a growing company,\n",
    "    + Less risky. Consequently both is cost of equity and cost of debt should be less. Cost of debt can be determined by looking at higher grade bonds, say, AAA, or by looking at the cost of debt of companies that are considered stable growth companies today. Cost of equity can be set to be equal to market risk. i.e., $\\beta=1$, and correspondingly, $ROE$ to expected market return\n",
    "    + Use more debt. Cost of capital is lesser due to more debt compared to equity (in addition to cheaper debt and equity)\n",
    "    + Reinvest less\n",
    "+ Period of extraordinary growth, that is, $N$ in our $PV$ calculations, comes just from good judgement. Professor doesn't propose any methodical way of arriving at it\n",
    "+ The growth rate $g2$ during the stable growth period can be decided by looking at the growth rate of a stable-growth company today, in the same industry, that our candidate company will resemble when the extraordinary growth period is over. \n",
    "+ $\\beta$ can be set to 1 or close to that for the stable growth period resulting in cost of equity looking like equity risk premium of the industry. The expectation is that mature companies in the same industry today have their cost of equity similar to ERP\n",
    "+ During the stable growth period, the return on equity is not expected to be much higher than the cost of equity. \n",
    "+ Reinvestment rate during the stable growth period $rir2$ is usually reverse engineered from the ROE and $g2$\n",
    "+ Risk-free rate used in a calculation should match the intended investment period. If we are valuing a stock with the intention of investing in it for 10 years, use 10 year T-bond as $R_f$ in CAPM calculations, and not a one-year Treasury note rate.\n",

    "# General thoughts on valuation\n",
    "One could choose to start valuation by selecting companies at the forefront of innovation in a new, expanding market, or on could choose to use a process of elimination to arrive at companies to evaluate via a process. The former will have person bias built into future investments at the very beginning of the valuation process itself, while the later may take too much time to work through.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a process of elimination is used, one can quickly eliminate\n",
    "+ Young companies that haven't found their scalable business model\n",
    "+ Stable companies that have lost track of their business model, trying all kinds of new things (Let us get into IoT because it is so hot now)\n",
    "+ Companies that generally are in bad health - bad interest coverage ratios, no emergency cash, very bad margins, too much leverage, using loans to pay dividends etc.\n",
    "+ Companies that are all over the place - like conglomerates - that have their profit spread out in multiple subsidieries in somewhat even fashion (In other words, conglomerates like Alphabet where the lion's share of profit comes from a single subsidiery, namely Google, may be OK).\n",
    "+ Any business that doesn't have a simple, straight forwards story. One should be easily able to create a business canvas for that company.\n",
    "    + There may be businesses with complex stories that may be undervalued. But tracking them, after investing in them, and understanding whether they are performing as expected may be too much work. \n",
    "+ Companies where accountants seem to be playing too many tricks, and companies where the management desperately tries to maintain a good image (by, say, smoothening out their dividends), while the reality isn't that good. We can call these \"Modi companies\" - basically companies that are trying to deceive investors\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is that an individual investor is spoilt for choice - there are thousands of companies in a chosen county and there are several countries to choose as well. But at EoD, the individual investor is only going to invest in not more than 10 companies. So eliminating companies with the most stringent of criterion will still result in too many choices - one shouldn't worry about using too many rules or eliminating most companies quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Young growth companies may not have a positive or steady (or both) operating margins. In that case, we should start with the revenue, make some assumption about operating margins, use sales-to-capital as a measure of returns, and do an FCFF valuation. FCFF method is probably more suitable than FCFE method as FCFF nethod would require less assumptions - particularly regarding amout of leverage the company would use in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real growth in revenues (as opposed to growth because of increasing price of its produts) may come about for a company because they may be expanding their market share, or because the market itself is expanding. A company that is undervalued, but growing, serving a market who size is expanding probably make for the best choices for investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies that have a brand recognition shouldn't be investing too many dollars to generate one sales dollar. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we label a company as a stable growth company or young company with great potential etc, we should verify our story from various angles. For instance, a stable growth company should have the following characteristics:\n",
    "+ It must be spending very little on R&D\n",
    "+ It should have higher leverage ratio than young growth companies in the same industry\n",
    "+ Its retention ratio must be small compared to young growth companies in the same industry\n",
    "+ Its revenue growth must be steady and below the growth rate of the economy, margins steady save black swan events and its dividends must be regular and smooth\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof of the pie is in the pudding - There may be many qualitative drivers of value, but a companies fundamentals are the only clear evidence that those qualitative drivers are indeed working. So it is OK to say that a company is innovating, but if they aren't able to monetize their innovation, it is of no use to the investor (Ex. Google glass)\n",

    "# Musings about value\n",
    "+ The value of anything is the value of another thing that you would exchange, directly or indirectly, to buy that thing. Think about barter trading: The value of a bag of rice is equal to the value of, say, a piece of furniture. There is no alternative way of thinking about value of an item. It is like how, in physics, position and time are always relative to some reference point. \n",
    "    + If you don't keep a maid, do all the house cleaning yourself, the value of the house cleaning tasks you do is equal to the value of the other task that you could be doing, but which you swapped for cleaning the house instead. For ex., if it takes you 10 hours to clean your house, but if you didn't do it, you could have, say, done 10 hours of some consultancy work, then the value of (or the cost of) the house work, in INR, is how much you would have earned doing consultancy work instead. This is what opportunity cost is. \"Opportunity cost\" is fancy way of describing basic barter trading. Now if the opportunity cost is, say, Rs. 10K, and a maid could be employed to do the same work for Rs. 2K, then by employing a maid, you have reduced the cost of house cleaning by 8000 rupees! In other words, there is no intrinsic cost of cleaning the house - it is only relational. In this example, it is rational for you to employ a maid because your opportunity cost is higher than the cost of keeping a maid. But why does the maid take up the job? It is because her opportunity cost of taking up this job is lower than Rs. 2K. That is, by accepting this job, she is forgoing another job that she could take, say, in a construction site - If that job would pay her less than Rs. 2K for the same 10 hour work, then it makes sense for her to accept your job offer\n",
    "+ When you get a house loan for investing in real estate, the bank assesses the appropriate interest rate based on, among other things, the geographical location of the house and how much its value is expected to appreciate. Say, it is 10%. The question is, if the bank knows how to estimate the value appreciation a house in a locality, why doesn't it directly buy the house instead of lending you the money? That is because bank, as an organisation, has people who are well versed with looking at statistical data and coming up with decision like how much interest rate to charge. So what they are assessing is like the CAPM expected return or the risk (or vice versa). But you may be a domain expert in real-estate: You know what other people, including the bank don't know. For example, you may know that a certain type of interior decoration or a certain type of balcony view is psychologically satisfactory to house buyers - that is a knowledge you gathered from working in the industry for several years - something that bank and other people do not possess. This is like the $\\alpha$ that fund managers deliver above CAPM required rate of return. In fact, one could expand this rationale for corporate loans as well: Why won't banks do oil exploration instead of giving loans to oil exploration companies etc.\n",
    "    + Suppose you are the CFO of a company and you decide to take a bank loan, for say, 15% APR, for a project, then it means you think your companies domain extertise in the concerned project's domain, makes it less riskier, or more rewarding, that what the bank thinks. If this is not true, then you shouldn't be borrowing!"
