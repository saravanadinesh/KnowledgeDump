    "# Asset\n",
    "+ An \"asset\" is anything that generates cash flows at any/several points in the future.\n",
    "+ An asset can be financed by the asset's \"owners\", a.k.a., equity holders, by either using their own money or by borrowing from a bank. i.e., Assets = Equity + Liabilities. So a balance sheet is nothing but assets on the left hand side and what financed those assets on the right hand side\n",
    "+ An asset is said to be operating if it generates a cashflow. Suppose you buy a car with the intention of using it as a taxi, it is an operating asset if you do use it as a taxi and generate revenue. If the car is sitting idle in the parking lot, it is a non-operating asset\n",
    "+ The value of an asset is the sum of all cashflows (discounted at the appropriate rates), it generates from now to forever in the future. i.e., it's present value. It's past does not matter. An asset itself doesn't have any value unless it generates cash flows. In the previous example, the car sitting in the parking lot was a non-operating asset. Although it has a market value, unless it is sold, it doesn't generate a cash flow, and hence, doesn't have a value. So a car that is going to be sitting in a parking lot forever has a present value of zero dollars, and a net present value (N.P.V.) of negative value\n",
    "+ The money spent on creating an asset is a \"capital expense\". The other type of expense is an operating expense. The easy way to judge if something is capex or opex, is to check whether it is going to generate cash. In other words, money spent as capital expense comes back to you (hopefully at a higher value), but money spent on an operating expense is forever lost.\n",
    "    - A house is a capex as it can generate cashflows from rent and then from an eventual sale. But minimum energy costs you have to pay, whether you are using it or not, the maintainence costs you have to spend whether you are using it or not, are all opex\n",
    "    - Educating expense are a capex - you expect to use the education to get a job and generate a cash flow from the salaries. Food is an operating expense - you will never recover anything from it. But a person needs food to operate. Hence it is called an operating expense. Operating expense is whatever is essential of keeping the asset operating - preventing it from becoming a non-operating asset\n",
    "    - COGS appear only if goods are created. OpEx is the expense that is independent of whether or not the goods are created. For example, if you are a copacker, electricity cost incurred when the machines are running - doing packaging - is part of COGS. Suppose you get no orders for a month, COGS will correspondingly be zero as you will simply switch the machines off. But just to keep the business operational, you have to spend a minimum amount to keep lights on at the front office, pay lobby person, phone bill, pay accounted to file IT returns etc. They will be part of OpEx.\n",
    "+ Most assets depreciate in value over time. A car purchased for use as a taxi, will be losing its value over time. This depreciation needs to be accounted as an operating expense. \n",
    "    - Right at the moment you purchase a car, your assets remain unchanged in value - only changed in form: What was earlier in the form of cash is now in the form of a car. But from that point on, the car's value starts depreciating and your asset value starts going down. If the car doesn't generate cashflows to makeup for the depreciation (or more than make up for it), then it means you have destroyed value. \n",
    "    - If you purchase a car at say Rs. 10 lakhs, and if you try to sell it a year from now, if you get Rs. 8 lakhs, it means the value of the car depreciated by Rs. 2 lakhs. You need to account that as an operating expense. Assets can decrease linearly (straight line depreciation), i.e., Rs. 2 lakhs every year, or non-linearly. Cars usually depreciate non-linearly. But most corporate assets are regarded as depreciating in a straight line\n",
    "+ Any capex accounted as opex over a period of time is said to be \"amortized\". Depreciation is one type of amortization. But usually the word \"amortizing\" is used while talking about capex that are not assets - Money spent buying a truck is \"depreciated\", whereas, license paid to operate the trucking company is \"amortized\". The basic process of depreciation and amortization are same. hence they are always referred to together \n",
    "+ The part of the assets remaining after subtracting liabilities is what belongs to the equity holders. The moneys borrowed to finance an asset is called \"leverage\". If, say, you buy a \\\\$500K house with $100K of your own money and \\\\$400K of banks money, then it is said to be a leveraged buyout or \"LBO\", and you are levered 5:1. This is because, if the value of the house appreciates to, say, \\\\$600K (after netting out interest expenses), then you would have made \\\\$200K, that is twice the money: You contributed only 1/5th or 20\\% for acquiring an asset, but made out a 5x profit of 100\\%. This is because the bank gets only \\\\$400K no matter how much the house appreciates. It is called \"leverage\" because it acts like a lever in physics. Leverage works the other way as well. If the house's market value reduces by 20\\% the equity holder loses 100\\% of his investment.\n",
    "+ Borrowing might make good sense if one can invest that money at the same risk level as the bank investing it is taking, while getting more returns than the bank interest rate. In other words, you have a talent/knowledge that the bank doesn't have - and you use this talent/knowledge to achieve returns that people, on an average, cannot achieve by taking the same amount of risk\n",
    "\n",
    "# Liabilities\n",
    "+ Debt doesn't necessarily mean short-term/long-term loans from a bank. A long-term lease on a building is also a debt. Debt has the following characteristics:\n",
    "    - It has contractual commitments\n",
    "    - It is tax deductible \n",
    "    - If contractual obligations are not met, some bad things (ex. foreclosure) happen\n",
    "\n",
    "# Income and expenses\n",
    "+ Revenue can go up because of one or more of the following reasons (mentioned here for product companies. But a analogue works for service companies too)\n",
    "    - More units sold\n",
    "    - Same units sold as before, but sold at higher prices. This is not in itself bad. This means that customers saw increased value in the product\n",
    "    - Inflation increased. In this case, the real revenue didn't go up - only the nominal revenue went up\n",
    "+ Gross income = Revenue - Cost of Sales (COGS). COGS is like the raw material needed to make a product. Gross income hence represents the value added by the product. If we add all the value additions, i.e., the gross incomes, of all the companies in a country, then it becomes the Gross Domestic Product. In other words, if companies in India, small and big, producing every imaginable good/service, were to merge together, then the Gross income of that super company would be the GDP of India. In that case, since, all the raw material coming from within India would be also be part of the company's value addition, it will be considered as part of the Gross Income. Only the raw materials coming from outside the country - in this case, outside the super company - will be considered as COGS. This is basically all the imports.\n",
    "+ One can broadly classify expenses into four types: Gross expenses (COGS), operational expenses (SG&A, office energy costs etc.), capital expenses (D&A) and financial expenses (interest expense)\n",
    "+ COGS is that expense that linearly increases with units sold. It is that expense is that directly associated with the production of goods. For ex., energy cost in running production machinery is COGS, but energy cost for the office building that houses marketing, sales teams is opex\n",
    "+ R&D expenses are treated as operating expenses for accounting purposes. But these are really capex. \n",
    "+ Net income could increase because:\n",
    "    - Revenue increased, which could mean the company now has more customers or the value of the company's goods/services has increase or both\n",
    "    - COGS decreased. This may be a cyclical thing which would hence be temporary. If, somehow, a new innovation has reduced COGS, this could be a permanent thing, which is very good for your company\n",
    "    - Company optimized opex. While this is good, the thing to remember is, the net income increase in this case doesn't mean the company is growing. It only became more efficient. In fact, it is possible that losing market share may be offset by temporary improvement in opex (say, by firing some staff), which may mask the company's problems in the short term, but exacerbate them in the long term\n",
    "    - Long term lease is often listed in the income statement as opex. But due to its nature, it is actually debt. So one should be careful with it\n",

    "## Real estate investment trust\n",
    "+ Since most of real estate is about converting assets from one form to another (cash to property and back to cash), income statement may not reflect how much the firm is growing - Retained income may be small or zero, but assets may be growing enormously every year \n",

    "# Musings about value\n",
    "+ The value of anything is the value of another thing that you would exchange, directly or indirectly, to buy that thing. Think about barter trading: The value of a bag of rice is equal to the value of, say, a piece of furniture. There is no alternative way of thinking about value of an item. It is like how, in physics, position and time are always relative to some reference point. \n",
    "    + If you don't keep a maid, do all the house cleaning yourself, the value of the house cleaning tasks you do is equal to the value of the other task that you could be doing, but which you swapped for cleaning the house instead. For ex., if it takes you 10 hours to clean your house, but if you didn't do it, you could have, say, done 10 hours of some consultancy work, then the value of (or the cost of) the house work, in INR, is how much you would have earned doing consultancy work instead. This is what opportunity cost is. \"Opportunity cost\" is fancy way of describing basic barter trading. Now if the opportunity cost is, say, Rs. 10K, and a maid could be employed to do the same work for Rs. 2K, then by employing a maid, you have reduced the cost of house cleaning by 8000 rupees! In other words, there is no intrinsic cost of cleaning the house - it is only relational. In this example, it is rational for you to employ a maid because your opportunity cost is higher than the cost of keeping a maid. But why does the maid take up the job? It is because her opportunity cost of taking up this job is lower than Rs. 2K. That is, by accepting this job, she is forgoing another job that she could take, say, in a construction site - If that job would pay her less than Rs. 2K for the same 10 hour work, then it makes sense for her to accept your job offer\n",
    "+ When you get a house loan for investing in real estate, the bank assesses the appropriate interest rate based on, among other things, the geographical location of the house and how much its value is expected to appreciate. Say, it is 10%. The question is, if the bank knows how to estimate the value appreciation a house in a locality, why doesn't it directly buy the house instead of lending you the money? That is because bank, as an organisation, has people who are well versed with looking at statistical data and coming up with decision like how much interest rate to charge. So what they are assessing is like the CAPM expected return or the risk (or vice versa). But you may be a domain expert in real-estate: You know what other people, including the bank don't know. For example, you may know that a certain type of interior decoration or a certain type of balcony view is psychologically satisfactory to house buyers - that is a knowledge you gathered from working in the industry for several years - something that bank and other people do not possess. This is like the $\\alpha$ that fund managers deliver above CAPM required rate of return. In fact, one could expand this rationale for corporate loans as well: Why won't banks do oil exploration instead of giving loans to oil exploration companies etc.\n",
    "    + Suppose you are the CFO of a company and you decide to take a bank loan, for say, 15% APR, for a project, then it means you think your companies domain extertise in the concerned project's domain, makes it less riskier, or more rewarding, that what the bank thinks. If this is not true, then you shouldn't be borrowing!\n",
