    "Suppose you find out there is a market for a product in your local area - say organic grape juice in the local department store. Market research. Pricing. You make the product and start selling. In the beginning the growth of the company will be limited by the availability of capital and how often you can plowback you earnings, the rate at which you can hire employees etc. At this stage, perhaps you don't spend any money on advertising and people just happen to pick up your product as they browse the aisles. In this case, the growth rate would reduce and eventually become zero. You might realize that to grow any further, you can try one of the following:\n",
    "  1. Spend money on advertising - Increase in implicit costs for some customers\n",
    "  2. Increase the price or decrease the price - whichever is better (Price elasticity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that when customers have to travel from far away to buy your product, their implicit costs increase and hence they will look to pay lower amount than the locals do. If your business is truly innovative, you will be a monopoly and you can decide how much to produce. Your willingness to produce goods at lower prices will be limited by the benefits of engaing in an alternative endeavour. Suppose, relative to the profit you will make by producing certain good is lower than what you would make in alternative endeavour if you used the same capital and effort you put into this endeavour. Everything in business is relative to something else.\n",

You tell your friends about the business and they want to help you out - They gift you a juicer. You own a place near the local university - You open the shop in that place.

    "# Random Thoughts\n",
    "## Revenue\n",
    "+ Revenue can increase because of one or more of the following reasons:\n",
    "    + The market size increased and the company is just riding the wave. This is the same as saying demand curve has shifted to the right. More players can be expected to enter the market\n",
    "    + The market share of the compnay may have increased. The could mean either the company is doing something right as compared to the competition or the competition is donig something wrong (think Boeing). In the latter case, the market share increase isn't really a proof of the company management's superemacy.\n",
    "    + Market size/share can increase because more people are buying the product or because the same number of people are now seeing higher value or just because of inflation. For instance, Americans probably buy just as many smartphones today that they did a decade ago. But in the last 10 years, they may have started seeing more valuing in having a smart phone and hence are willing to pay higher prices \n",
    "\n",
    "## Working Capital\n",
    "+ Working Capital can be thought of a battery charge that starts an engine. You need the battery to have charge just to start the engine for the first time. Once started the engine will keep chargin the battery. If the car has been non-operational for a long time - like sitting in a parking lot - the battery will slowly leak and eventually you need a jump start or a new battery to start the engine. Working capital in a non-operating company will leak because the company still has to pay some expenses like rent, basics bills (like to keep the lights on in the lobby). Eventually to restart the company, they have to get external money - like a jump start - from a new investor or a bank loan\n",
    "+ Working Capital can come in the form of payables. Can a company just take raw materials on credit and get the operations started on zero working capital (Current assets = current liabilities)?\n",
    "+ Reinvestment rate may not always be accurately reflected by the financial statements because reinvestment can occur right after the financial period and continue throughout the next period except the time when the period ends. You will end up thinking that the reinvestment rate is low. How can we rectify this? \n",

    "## Leverage\n",
    "There are two types of leverages - at least those I know of - operating and financial. The basic idea of leverage in its simplest form has to do with the equation that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = y - F\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$x$ could stand for profit, equity etc. and $y$ could stand for revenue, asset value etc., and $F$ stands for some fixed quantity, i.e., fixed costs, debt etc. Suppose $x_0$ and $y_0$ are the initial values. Sometime later $y$ increases to a higher value by $r\\%$ to $y_1. The maths shows us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x_1 &= y_1 - F \\\\\n",
    "    &= y_0(1+r) - F \\\\\n",
    "    &= (y_0 - F) + y_0 \\times r \\\\\n",
    "    &= x_0 + y_0 \\times r\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$    \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $y_0$ is the value of an asset - say, a house - and it increase by $100K ($y_0\\times r$), then all we are saying is that the equity will increase by $100K as well. Now $\\dfrac{y_1}{y_0} = 1+r$. What is $\\dfrac{x_1}{x_0}?. Let us find it by dividing both sides of the above equation by $x_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dfrac{x_1}{x_0} = 1+\\dfrac{y_0}{x_0}\\times r\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$\\dfrac{y_0}{x_0}$ is *leverage*. So, when $y$ increases by $r$, $x$ increases by $leverage\\times r$. How can we increase leverage? By increasing $F$. This can be shown easily:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x &= y - F \\\\\n",
    "1 &= \\dfrac{y}{x} - \\dfrac{F}{x} \\\\\n",
    "\\dfrac{y}{x} &= 1+\\dfrac{F}{x}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are talking about a companies assets, equity and debt, then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\dfrac{A}{E} &= 1 + \\dfrac{D}{E} \\\\\n",
    "Leverage = 1+\\dfrac{D}{E} \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes $\\dfrac{D}{E}$ itself is referred to as \"leverage\" and $\\dfrac{A}{E}$ is referred to as the \"equity multiplier\". So when someone says the leverage is 4x, you need to make sure what they mean, $\\dfrac{A}{E}$ or $\\dfrac{D}{E}$. Leverage is more of a concept than a well defined parameter. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp#:~:text=Financial%20leverage%20is%20the%20strategic,without%20using%20additional%20personal%20capital.) has parameters that are related to financial leverage in a company. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Leverage from a different angle\n",
    "Financial leverage is all about how much to borrow. RoA, i.e., Op Income divided by assets is useful to make that decision. Suppose a company has to no liabilities in the beginning. So equity $E$ is the same as assets $A$. When it borrows the first time $L$ is added to the assets, the assets become $A_{new} = A_{old}+L$ but the equity remains the same. Let us assume that loan interest rate is $i$. In the next period the equity becomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "E_{new} &= A_{new} (1+RoA) - L (1+i) \\\\\n",
    "        &= (A_{old}+L)(1+ROA) - L (1+i) \\\\\n",
    "        &= E_{old}(1+ROA)+L(ROA-i)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$            \n",
    "\n",
    "So not only that your equity will improve by the rate of $ROA$, it will increase additionally by the difference between the return of the business and the interest on the loan, scaled by the total loan amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost of leverage\n",
    "Not all assets have cashflows (incomes) associated with them. But if they do, you can look at the returns on investment and see if it is higher than the cost of capital. Otherwise, even without all the leverage jazz, it doesn't make sense to take a loan. "
