    "Suppose you find out there is a market for a product in your local area - say organic grape juice in the local department store. Market research. Pricing. You make the product and start selling. In the beginning the growth of the company will be limited by the availability of capital and how often you can plowback you earnings, the rate at which you can hire employees etc. At this stage, perhaps you don't spend any money on advertising and people just happen to pick up your product as they browse the aisles. In this case, the growth rate would reduce and eventually become zero. You might realize that to grow any further, you can try one of the following:\n",
    "  1. Spend money on advertising - Increase in implicit costs for some customers\n",
    "  2. Increase the price or decrease the price - whichever is better (Price elasticity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that when customers have to travel from far away to buy your product, their implicit costs increase and hence they will look to pay lower amount than the locals do. If your business is truly innovative, you will be a monopoly and you can decide how much to produce. Your willingness to produce goods at lower prices will be limited by the benefits of engaing in an alternative endeavour. Suppose, relative to the profit you will make by producing certain good is lower than what you would make in alternative endeavour if you used the same capital and effort you put into this endeavour. Everything in business is relative to something else.\n",

    "## Revenue\n",
    "+ Revenue can increase because of one or more of the following reasons:\n",
    "    + The market size increased and the company is just riding the wave. This is the same as saying demand curve has shifted to the right. More players can be expected to enter the market\n",
    "    + The market share of the compnay may have increased. The could mean either the company is doing something right as compared to the competition or the competition is donig something wrong (think Boeing). In the latter case, the market share increase isn't really a proof of the company management's superemacy.\n",
    "    + Market size/share can increase because more people are buying the product or because the same number of people are now seeing higher value or just because of inflation. For instance, Americans probably buy just as many smartphones today that they did a decade ago. But in the last 10 years, they may have started seeing more valuing in having a smart phone and hence are willing to pay higher prices \n",
    "\n",
    "## Working Capital\n",
    "+ Working Capital can be thought of a battery charge that starts an engine. You need the battery to have charge just to start the engine for the first time. Once started the engine will keep chargin the battery. If the car has been non-operational for a long time - like sitting in a parking lot - the battery will slowly leak and eventually you need a jump start or a new battery to start the engine. Working capital in a non-operating company will leak because the company still has to pay some expenses like rent, basics bills (like to keep the lights on in the lobby). Eventually to restart the company, they have to get external money - like a jump start - from a new investor or a bank loan\n",
    "+ Working Capital can come in the form of payables. Can a company just take raw materials on credit and get the operations started on zero working capital (Current assets = current liabilities)?\n",
    "+ Reinvestment rate may not always be accurately reflected by the financial statements because reinvestment can occur right after the financial period and continue throughout the next period except the time when the period ends. You will end up thinking that the reinvestment rate is low. How can we rectify this? \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$x$ could stand for profit, equity etc. and $y$ could stand for contribution margin, asset value etc., and $F$ stands for some fixed quantity, i.e., fixed costs, debt etc. Suppose $x_0$ and $y_0$ are the initial values. Sometime later $y$ increases to a higher value by $r\\%$ to $y_1$. The maths shows us:\n",

Now $\\dfrac{y_1}{y_0}-1 = r$. What is $\\dfrac{x_1}{x_0}-1$?. Let us find it by dividing both sides of the above equation by $x_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dfrac{x_1}{x_0} -1 = \\dfrac{y_0}{x_0}\\times r\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$\\dfrac{y_0}{x_0}$ is *leverage*. So, when $y$ increases by $r$, $x$ increases by $leverage\\times r$. How can we increase leverage? By increasing $F$. This can be shown easily:\n",

    "### Cost of leverage\n",
    "Financial leverage comes with a cost - the interest you need to pay on the loans. This wasn't considered originally for the sake of explaining the general concept. But this cost is important. Suppose you create an asset with some equity and some leverage with a cost of leverage $i$:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "D_{new} = D (1+i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From these two equations we can calculate the new equity as:\n",

    "### Incremental margin or Passthrough\n",
    "The idea of passthrough is related to leverage. While valuing companies, anytime people calculate EBIT, they also calculate the EBIT grwoth, margin as well as incremental margin, which is essentially \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Incremental\\ margin = \\dfrac{EBIT(y) - EBIT(y-1)}{Revenue(y) - Revenue(y-1)}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "This incremental margin represents the best margin the company can hope to achieve in the future (subject to some constraints). This idea is related to operating leverage. Suppose we model the total cost of a company as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "TC = m\\times R + FC\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, you can think of $m$ as the slope of the total cost line (vs. revenue). From this we can calculate contribution margin, operating leverage, profit and profit margin as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Contribution\\ margin = R(1-m) \\\\\n",
    "Operating\\ leverage = \\dfrac{R(1-m)}{FC} \\\\\n",
    "Profit = R(1-m) - FC \\\\\n",
    "Profit\\ margin = \\dfrac{R(1-m) - FC}{R}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, from one year to another, revenue changes from $R_1$ to $R_2$, then profit changes as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This $(1-m)$ factor is essentially the contribution margin ratio. It represents the incremental revenue \"passing through\" to the EBIT. So suppose $(1-m)$ is 0.8, then if the revenue increases by $100, $80 of it will be passed through to the EBIT. $1-m$ also represents the best margin a company can expect to go towards as it realizes its \"full potential\" where it has maximized its profit for a given fixed cost. This is because, when R becomes much bigger than FC.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Profit\\ margin = \\dfrac{R(1-m) - FC}{R} \\approx \\dfrac{R(1-m)}{R} = 1-m\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The important nuance here is the assumption that at some point we will have $revenue >> FC$. This may be true for software companies, semiconductor companies etc., which already have amazing margins. But this isn't true for manufacturing companies. Example: Suppose the company produces some soft drink using a bottling plant. Suppose they sell them at $2 a bottle. Say, their contribution margin ratio is 90\\% (because they are just using sugar syrup and water) and that their fixed costs are \\$8K per day (related to maintentance of the machines, labourers manning them etc.). Now if the plant is capable of producing 10K bottles a day, but is underutilized because the sales are only 5K bottles a day. At the moment, their revenue would be $5,000*\\$2 = \\$10,000$, contribution margin, $\\$10000*0.9 = \\$9,000$ and profit, $\\$9,000 - \\$8,000 = \\$1000$. This represents an EBIT margin of 10%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose their sales improves to the best possible level, i.e., 10K per day, then their profit would be $\\$18,000-\\$8,000 = \\$10,000$ and the margin would improve to 50%. Basically as sales increased by \\$10,000$, 90\\% of it passed through to the EBIT. But see, the company is now running already at 100\\% utilization. If sales were to increase any further, they will have to open a new bottling plant. We can clearly see, hence, that the maximum EBIT margin will ever reach is 50\\% and not 90\\%.  \n",
