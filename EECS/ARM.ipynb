    "The stack is a RAM area that is reserved to be used during the execution of the program to temporarily store register values, return address (during subroutine calls), parameter values (during subroutine calls), return value, local variables of a subroutine etc. For ex., when a subroutine is called, ARM Procedure Call Standard requires that it is the subroutines job to preserve the state of registers *r4*-*r11* if it plans to use any of it. So the subroutine will push the registers it wants to use in *r4*-*r11* into the stack and then once it is done using them, it will pop the stack and restore the register values. Similarly, when the main routine calls the subroutine, it will use the *bl* instruction, which will automatically store the return address in the *LR* register. The subroutine hence first pushes the contents of *LR* into the stack and then, at the end of execution, pops the originally pushed stack content into *PC*. This is all captured in the below example:\n",

    "Besides these uses, parameters passed to a sub-routine and its local variables can be stored in the stack and instructions can push/pop them using their relative locations from the *SP* register. The important point to note here is that, as the code executes and various subroutines are called and returned, the stack grows and wanes. Since this happens in runtime, it may not be possible to predict which functions may be called when, and hence, it is not possible to predict exactly how big the stack needs to be. So sometimes, the stack pointer goes out of the designated area into other memory areas (ex. heap) and this condition is called **stack overflow**\n",
