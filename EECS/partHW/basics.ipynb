    "# How batteries work\n",
    "[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5TqMuHaDuY) has the most acceptable explanation of all. Here is my unerstanding so far: A solution is something that will have positively charge ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions) existing in a lose form. So the solution overall is neutral. But as these ions are swimming around, they could react with things. A cell is made up of two half cells. The basic cell everyone uses to explain how a cell works consists of a zinc electrode submerged in a zinc nitrate solution making one half cell and a copper electrode dipped in a copper nitrate solution forming another half cell. Initially, the zinc electrode reacts with one of the swimming nitrate anions and releases two electrons. These electrons travel through the wire connecting the two electrodes to the copper electrode because the copper cations in the copper nitrate solution attract them. The result is that one zinc atom (gets oxidised) gets released into the zinc nitrate solution making it positively charged overall (because there is now one zinc cation too many in the solution. On the copper side, one copper cation gains two electrons and (gets reduced) becomes a copper atom leaving the solution and attaching to the copper electrode, making the copper nitrate solution slightly negatively charged. All of this is possible only because shit is swimming around in the solution - if cations and anions are attached tightly to each other, none of this would happen. Here is where it gets even more vague: After a point, the copper solution is too negatively charged and zinc solution two negatively charged for the swimming motherfuckers to continue reacting with their respective electrodes. Now comes the salt bridge - It is another solution, like potassium nitrate, that connects the zinc nitrate and copper nitrate solutions. This bridge allows the extra cations on one side to migrate over to the other side and extra anions to come over to this side. One may ask, if there is a salt bridge, why the electrons didn't go over the salt bridge instead of the wire. So apparently electrons have to remain very close to protons and that means they can travel only by jumping from one atom to another atom which is literally rubbing this atom. In a metal wire, these atoms are all right next to each other and hence this is possible. But in a solution, the atoms are too far away from one another for this to happen. \n",

    "# Capacitors\n",
    "A capacitor is like a diaphragm in a hydraudic system. When a pressure is applied at one end of the pipe containing the diaphragm, the diaphragm initially will show no resistance and start deforming. As it deforms, the fluid at both ends of the pipe will move making it seem like the fluid (current) is going through (whereas it actually isn't). But if the pressure is steadily applied (flat DC or increasing DC), then, at some point, the diaphragm will reach its max deformation and will fully resist (infinite resistance) - Or, it will break if the applied pressure is more than what the diaphragm can resist.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a capacitor faces an AC voltage, basically a push-pull happening repeatedly in a hydraulic system, then the diaphragm will keep deforming a little bit and go back to original form repeatedly. It will look like fluid is flowing back and forth the pipe containing the diaphragm. This is why a capacitor appears as a low resistance to AC voltages\n",
    "\n",
    "Capacitors don't like sudden change in voltages and inductors don't like sudden change in currents. Hence, a capacitor that has zero voltage across it when the circuit isn't connected to any power source, will act initially like a short when a power source is introduced to the circuit - When it acts like a short, the potential drop across the capacitor will be zero (that is pretty much how a \"short\" is defined), which was the potential across the capacitor just before the power source was introduced - So the capacitor basically exhibited a reluctance to sudden change in voltage. This property of a capacitor is useful to smoothen out voltage to a load (attached in parallel to the capacitor) while supply voltage is fluctuating. In this role the capacitor is referred to as a \"bypass capacitor\" as it bypasses the supply voltage noise to the ground instead of it going through the circuit. The capacitor can also be used in a reversed role - prevent the supply from being exposed to fluctuation in current demand by the load - Most power supplies are limited by the amount of current they can supply before their voltage output starts drooping. A capacitor can be used to store charge when the load is using up little current and then supply excess current when the load requires suddenly. Current requirement of complex systems are unpredictable. SoC's may switch on and off radios, accelerators etc. and CPU's switch on and off millions of transistors in unpredictable manner. But the system designer cannot spec out the power supply to meet the peak demand of the load - instead, one can spec out for the average demand, and when demand peaks once in a while, a capacitor parallel to the load can supply current. In this role, it is called a \"tank capacitor\". \n",

It is like accumulting river water over a long period of time in a water tank and then releasing all the water through a large pipe (low resistance) very quickly. This is achieved by using transistor valves, one on the input and one on the output of the capacitor. Basically the input valve would be closed, while the output valve is open and the capacitor charged to its max capacity and the input valve is opened and the output valve closed to discharge the accumulated energy onto a load. Since we already have the voltage and current equations for a simple capacitor charging and discharging circuits, we can derive the equations for the charging energy $E_C(T)$ and discharging energy $E_D(T)$ as:\n",

    "One can think of capacitance as the elasticity of a membrane in a hydraulic system - the more elastic it is, higher will be the energy that can be stored in it. Of course, if one where to apply very high pressure continuously on the membrane, it may push it beyond its breaking point and the membrane will simply tear - Capacitors have the same problem and hence come with voltage ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "One can find out that, during the charging phase, when $T=6R_SC$, the capacitor reaches 99.75% of its max value. Assuming that during the charging phase, we charged the capacitor for longer than this time, when we go to the discharge phase, we can approximate the initial voltage on the capacitor $v_{Ci}$ to be the same as the battery voltage $v_b$. Imagine a 100mAh LiPo battery that is rated at 1C. So it can supply upto 100mA at 3.7V, i.e., 370mW. Say we use a $100\\mu F$ cap, then we can accumulate a maximum of $1850\\mu J$, and then, if the load resistance $R_L = 1\\Omega$, we can discharge almost the entire energy in $600\\mu s$ resulting in an average of $3W$ power supply during that time. That is approximately an 8x gain. While energy dissipation from a capacitor can be dramatic, current supply can be even more dramatic. At the very instant discharging valve is closed, the current supply is 3.7A in the above example. Comparing that to 100mA, it is a 37x gain!\n",

    "# Inductors\n",
    "Inductors are like a horizontal spring attached to a load. If someone pushes the spring (apply voltage), initially the spring takes all the force and the load feels nothing - the inductor, when a power supply is suddenly introduced acts as a open at the very instance power is introduced. But then, as the spring starts collapsing, the load starts to feel more and more of the input force. Eventually the spring reaches its fully compressed state and now the load feels all the force applied further that point in time. The same happens with inductors: As time passes, the load sees more and more potential across it, until, finally, the inductor reaches a point where it has no potential drop across it (acts like a short) and the load sees all the applied from that point in time onwards. When the applied force stops, the spring will decompress on the side of the input supply if there is no resistance on that side now. However, if the supplied force is stopped, but it is ratcheted, the spring will instead release its stored energy on the load, continuing to push it further for some time even after input force is stopped\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also think of an inductor as a fan inside a pipe filled with water. When the water isn't flowing, the fan will be still. But if someone applied pressure at the input end of the pipe, the body of water located before the fan, will try to push on the fan - initially the fan will refuse to rotate, causing a push back on the water body (infinite resistance) - this, in inductors is called \"back emf\". But, in a moment, the fan will start rotating and water will start flowing across the fan - i.e., the inductor  will start passing current through it. The fan will rotate faster and faster until it reaches a point where water is steadily flowing through it as if the fan doesn't exist on its path. If the input pressure is stopped, the fan will continue rotating and this will continue moving water in the pipe for some time even after the input pressure is stopped. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inductors don't like sudden change in current through them. So one can use an inductor to regulate current going to a load attached in series with the inductor, to prevent sudden increases in current supply from the power plant - Mostly this doesn't happen in reality because most power sources have voltage fluctuation issues, but not current fluctuation issues. If anything, parasitic inductances on PCB traces, or wires in general, are considered bad because they prevent the load from getting more current when the requirements arises suddenly - even if the power plant, say, a battery, is capable of servicing the increased current demand, parasitic inductance would prevent the load from getting it. Tank capacitors are hence used for, not only supplying extra current when the power supply is incapable of doing so, but also to overcome the effects of parasitic impedences. This is the reason why tank capacitors are located as close as possible to the load because if not, the trace connecting the tank capacitor and the load may have parasitic inductances and that would defeat the whole purpose of the tank capacitor.\n",

    "Notice carefully how the positive and negative of the potential drops charge between the circuit and how the current direction changes across the load and the wire between the inductor and the load. The point here is that the inductor is like a freewheeling wheel and it will continue the current going through it even when the source is switched off. For AC loads, this isn't a problem. But digital electronics could blow up if polarity of voltage across Vcc and ground are reversed. Inductors in those cases aren't used in the configuration as shown. The load would be in series with the inductor, in which case, this problem of polarity reversal wouldn't arise."
