    "# Voltage, Charge, Current and Resistance\n",
    "Imagine a bucket of water raised to a height above of the *ground*. The water in the bucket now would have a potential energy directly proportional to 1. The amount of water (i.e., the mass of the water) in the bucket, 2. The height above which it is raised. Similarly when positively charged particles are lifted to a height (or separated along any dimension) from negatively charged particles, the potential energy thus created would be directly proportional to the distance of seperation, and the amount of the charged particles involved. Voltage is a proxy for the former and Charge (in coulombs) is the proxy for the later. Thus one can look at a battery as a bucket of water with the voltage representing how high above the *ground* the bucket is and the amount of charge representing the amount of water in that bucket. The reason I have italicized the ground is because, the potential energy in the bucket is relative to the ground from which it was presumably raised. Alternatively, if one stands on this *ground* and measures the kinetic energy of the water if it is poured down from the bucket, that energy would be equal to $m*g*h$ with *h* being the height of the water bucket from the point where the poured water hits the *ground*. You may say, \"duh!\", but this is important: If one used height from the sea level - the global point of reference for heights - found using, say, a barometer, and then releases that water to the *ground*, he/she should not be surprised if the kinetic energy is found to be less than $m*g*H$, where *H* is the height above the sea level. The same is true for voltage aka *potential*: Whenever we talk about voltage, we need to keep in mind what the reference point is. When we say a battery is a 1.5V battery, we mean that the positive side of the battery is 1.5V above the negative side of the battery. This is why *potential difference* is a better term than *potential*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us move to energy transmission. Imagine a world that runs completely on water wheels; a world where the government \"produces\" energy by raising buckets of water up to a long sloping ramp going to a massive tank in a city, which is then consumed by the townspeople through pipes coming down from the tank to their homes onto their personal waterwheels. In this case, if the government measured the energy transmitted by using height at which the ramp begins (presumably near a river) and people measure the energy they are consuming based on the kinetic energy of the water hitting their water wheels, then these two figures won't add up. This is where having a global reference point such as the sea level is useful. The same is true for electricity production and consumption: We use the *earth* as the universal point of measurement of voltage. *Earth* is literally the earth under our feet. It is considered that since the entire planet is one large sphere, the potential difference between the earth at the power plant and earth in your house would be zero - or close or zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Getting back to the bucket of water raised to a height. Now imagine we connect a pipe to the bottom of the bucket (by making a suitably sized hole) all the way to the ground, then water would drain out of the bucket at a rate determined by the diameter of the pipe - the larger the pipe, faster the water current would be. Electric current, named after water current, is the rate of flow of charge. And resistance in a circuit is like the friction in the water pipe: The thicker the wire, lower the resistance and hence faster the flow of charge. \n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of charge in a battery can be represented in coloumbs or, in a reverse sense, from current units.For instance a 2000mAH battery is basically has $2000*m*\\frac{C}{sec}*60sec = 120 C* charge. The reason why batteries use *mAh* instead of *coulombs* has got something to do with the max current - aka the *C rating* of the battery (The *C* in *C rating* shouldn't be confused for coloumbs). I have an entire document written on batteries in the Google Drive - but the short version is, if a 2000mAh battery is rated at *1C* then it means its max current output can be 2000mA. If the same capacity battery is rated at *2C* it means its max current can be 4000mA. This max current has something to do with the *internal resistance* of the battery which is explained in the next paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our water bucket analogy, suppose the bucket itself has a short pipe to which any pipe can be connected to the ground, then that short pipe's diameter would also restrict the water current. Similarly sources of electric power, such as a battery, also have *internal resistances* which, along with the resistance of the circuit determine the electric current.  In the Physics knowledge dump basics notes, I had mentioned how power, and not energy, informs the application and taken the example of wood vs. gasoline. One can extend that to batteries. A LiPo and a LiMnO2 (Typical coin cell battery chemistry) may both have the same energy but have different max current outputs. So which LiPo is used for smart phones, requiring rapid recharging, LiMnO2 is used for the real time clock on motherboard because of low power consumption and also the need to run for a very long time without needed replacement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the *internal resistance* of a battery may not have anything to do with resistance to the passing of electric charges, but a restriction caused by how quickly chemical reactions inside the battery can take place in order to produce that current. So *internal resistance* is a theoretical concept that is useful for teaching/learing, but should not be taken literally. To emphasize this, most often the term \"Equivalent Series Resistance\" is used instead of \"internal resistance\" in formal literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "In any circuit you draw, it is important to show where the reference point is so that your audience can understand without ambuiguity what you mean by a voltage figure mentioned either on the diagram or accompanying text. For example in the following diagram the point between the two resistors is at 2.5V. \n",

    "    <figcaption>Point of reference at the negative of the battery</figcaption>\n",

    "However, if we move the resistor as shown below, which seems like an innocent change, and inadvertantly move the reference point (aka common point) then the meeting point of the two resistors will be at 0V while the positive and negative sides of the battery will be at 2.5V and -2.5V respectively. In fact SPICE simulators won't run a simulation unless you mention a reference point in the circuit (how else can the correctly show the voltage values in the graphs). So make it a habit to mention the point of reference in a circuit diagram\n",

    "# How batteries work\n",
    "[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5TqMuHaDuY) has the most acceptable explanation of all. Here is my unerstanding so far: A solution is something that will have positively charge ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions) existing in a lose form. So the solution overall is neutral. But as these ions are swimming around, they could react with things. A cell is made up of two half cells. The basic cell everyone uses to explain how a cell works consists of a zinc electrode submerged in a zinc nitrate solution making one half cell and a copper electrode dipped in a copper nitrate solution forming another half cell. Initially, the zinc electrode reacts with one of the swimming nitrate anions and releases two electrons. These electrons travel through the wire connecting the two electrodes to the copper electrode because the copper cations in the copper nitrate solution attract them. The result is that one zinc atom (gets oxidised) gets released into the zinc nitrate solution making it positively charged overall (because there is now one zinc cation too many in the solution. On the copper side, one copper cation gains two electrons and (gets reduced) becomes a copper atom leaving the solution and attaching to the copper electrode, making the copper nitrate solution slightly negatively charged. All of this is possible only because shit is swimming around in the solution - if cations and anions are attached tightly to each other, none of this would happen. Here is where it gets even more vague: After a point, the copper solution is too negatively charged and zinc solution two negatively charged for the swimming motherfuckers to continue reacting with their respective electrodes. Now comes the salt bridge - It is another solution, like potassium nitrate, that connects the zinc nitrate and copper nitrate solutions. This bridge allows the extra cations on one side to migrate over to the other side and extra anions to come over to this side. One may ask, if there is a salt bridge, why the electrons didn't go over the salt bridge instead of the wire. So apparently electrons have to remain very close to protons and that means they can travel only by jumping from one atom to another atom which is literally rubbing this atom. In a metal wire, these atoms are all right next to each other and hence this is possible. But in a solution, the atoms are too far away from one another for this to happen. "

    "# Capacitors\n",
    "A capacitor is like a diaphragm in a hydraudic system. When a pressure is applied at one end of the pipe containing the diaphragm, the diaphragm initially will show no resistance and start deforming. As it deforms, the fluid at both ends of the pipe will move making it seem like the fluid (current) is going through (whereas it actually isn't). But if the pressure is steadily applied (flat DC or increasing DC), then, at some point, the diaphragm will reach its max deformation and will fully resist (infinite resistance) - Or, it will break if the applied pressure is more than what the diaphragm can resist.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a capacitor faces an AC voltage, basically a push-pull happening repeatedly in a hydraulic system, then the diaphragm will keep deforming a little bit and go back to original form repeatedly. It will look like fluid is flowing back and forth the pipe containing the diaphragm. This is why a capacitor appears as a low resistance to AC voltages\n",
    "\n",
    "Capacitors don't like sudden change in voltages and inductors don't like sudden change in currents. Hence, a capacitor that has zero voltage across it when the circuit isn't connected to any power source, will act initially like a short when a power source is introduced to the circuit - When it acts like a short, the potential drop across the capacitor will be zero (that is pretty much how a \"short\" is defined), which was the potential across the capacitor just before the power source was introduced - So the capacitor basically exhibited a reluctance to sudden change in voltage. This property of a capacitor is useful to smoothen out voltage to a load (attached in parallel to the capacitor) while supply voltage is fluctuating. In this role the capacitor is referred to as a \"bypass capacitor\" as it bypasses the supply voltage noise to the ground instead of it going through the circuit. The capacitor can also be used in a reversed role - prevent the supply from being exposed to fluctuation in current demand by the load - Most power supplies are limited by the amount of current they can supply before their voltage output starts drooping. A capacitor can be used to store charge when the load is using up little current and then supply excess current when the load requires suddenly. Current requirement of complex systems are unpredictable. SoC's may switch on and off radios, accelerators etc. and CPU's switch on and off millions of transistors in unpredictable manner. But the system designer cannot spec out the power supply to meet the peak demand of the load - instead, one can spec out for the average demand, and when demand peaks once in a while, a capacitor parallel to the load can supply current. In this role, it is called a \"tank capacitor\". \n",

This is achieved by using transistor valves, one on the input and one on the output of the capacitor. Basically the input valve would be closed, while the output valve is open and the capacitor charged to its max capacity and the input valve is opened and the output valve closed to discharge the accumulated energy onto a load. Since we already have the voltage and current equations for a simple capacitor charging and discharging circuits, we can derive the equations for the charging energy $E_C(T)$ and discharging energy $E_D(T)$ as:\n",

    "One can find out that, during the charging phase, when $T=6R_SC$, the capacitor reaches 99.75% of its max value. Assuming that during the charging phase, we charged the capacitor for longer than this time, when we go to the discharge phase, we can approximate the initial voltage on the capacitor $v_{Ci}$ to be the same as the battery voltage $v_b$. Imagine a 100mAh LiPo battery that is rated at 1C. So it can supply upto 100mA at 3.7V, i.e., 370mW. Say we use a $100\\mu F$ cap, then we can accumulate a maximum of $1850\\mu J$, and then, if the load resistance $R_L = 1\\Omega$, we can discharge almost the entire energy in $200\\mu s$ resulting in an average of $9.25W$ power supply during that time. That is approximately an 25x gain. While energy dissipation from a capacitor can be dramatic, current supply can be even more dramatic. At the very instant discharging valve is closed, the current supply is 3.7A in the above example. Comparing that to 100mA, it is a 37x gain!\n",

    "# Inductors\n",
    "Inductors are like a horizontal spring attached to a load. If someone pushes the spring (apply voltage), initially the spring takes all the force and the load feels nothing - the inductor, when a power supply is suddenly introduced acts as a open at the very instance power is introduced. But then, as the spring starts collapsing, the load starts to feel more and more of the input force. Eventually the spring reaches its fully compressed state and now the load feels all the force applied further that point in time. The same happens with inductors: As time passes, the load sees more and more potential across it, until, finally, the inductor reaches a point where it has no potential drop across it (acts like a short) and the load sees all the applied from that point in time onwards. When the applied force stops, the spring will decompress on the side of the input supply if there is no resistance on that side now. However, if the supplied force is stopped, but it is ratcheted, the spring will instead release its stored energy on the load, continuing to push it further for some time even after input force is stopped\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also think of an inductor as a fan inside a pipe filled with water. When the water isn't flowing, the fan will be still. But if someone applied pressure at the input end of the pipe, the body of water located before the fan, will try to push on the fan - initially the fan will refuse to rotate, causing a push back on the water body (infinite resistance) - this, in inductors is called \"back emf\". But, in a moment, the fan will start rotating and water will start flowing across the fan - i.e., the inductor  will start passing current through it. The fan will rotate faster and faster until it reaches a point where water is steadily flowing through it as if the fan doesn't exist on its path. If the input pressure is stopped, the fan will continue rotating and this will continue moving water in the pipe for some time even after the input pressure is stopped. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inductors don't like sudden change in current through them. So one can use an inductor to regulate current going to a load attached in series with the inductor, to prevent sudden increases in current supply from the power plant - Mostly this doesn't happen in reality because most power sources have voltage fluctuation issues, but not current fluctuation issues. If anything, parasitic inductances on PCB traces, or wires in general, are considered bad because they prevent the load from getting more current when the requirements arises suddenly - even if the power plant, say, a battery, is capable of servicing the increased current demand, parasitic inductance would prevent the load from getting it. Tank capacitors are hence used for, not only supplying extra current when the power supply is incapable of doing so, but also to overcome the effects of parasitic impedences. This is the reason why tank capacitors are located as close as possible to the load because if not, the trace connecting the tank capacitor and the load may have parasitic inductances and that would defeat the whole purpose of the tank capacitor.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice carefully how the positive and negative of the potential drops charge between the circuit and how the current direction changes across the load and the wire between the inductor and the load. The point here is that the inductor is like a freewheeling wheel and it will continue the current going through it even when the source is switched off. For AC loads, this isn't a problem. But digital electronics could blow up if polarity of voltage across Vcc and ground are reversed. Inductors in those cases aren't used in the configuration as shown. The load would be in series with the inductor, in which case, this problem of polarity reversal wouldn't arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reversal of current during discharge would also arise in case of a capacitor if we have the capacitor in reseries with the load (See the \"Nuance about AC/DC section below)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy stored and released\n",
    "We use the same technique as we did with capacitors and end up with the following terms for energy stored in the inductor (While charging through series resistance $R_S$, and energy released into a load resistance $R_L$\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy stored:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "where, $I_{max}$ is the maximum current possible, i.e., $I_{max} = v_b/R_S$. In other words, as time progresses, the energy stored in an inductor asymtotically approaches $\\frac{1}{2}LI_{max}^2$ and one cannot store any more energy than this value. The remaining term, that is responsible for this asymptotic approach, is exactly the same as its peer term for capacitor, execpt the time constant is determined differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy released:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_R(T) = \\frac{1}{2}LI_{max}^2 \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{2T}{L/R_L}} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $I_{max}$ is the starting current (and the maximum current possible). We see again that the energy release equation is very similar to capacitor energy release equation. So energy stored in an inductor can be released quickly just as we can with a capacitor (if the load is switched). And this time, it is the voltage release that is dramatic. Although the current is limited by the max current that the power plant can supply, the volage increases with load resistance linearly. So if the load resistance is very high, the voltage is correspondingly very high, but it releases the energy very quickly because high resistance leads to faster exponential decay. This ability of a coil to generate very high voltages, albeit for a short period of time, is useful for bridging small air gaps - Air has a very high resistance and an inductor can be used to generate high voltages such as 40kV that is required to bridge air gaps between two metals. When the current ($I_{max}$) goes through the air gap, the heat generated can incinerate explosive gases, the principle used in IC engines. \n",
    "\n",
    "One important distinction between energy stored in an inductor and energy stored in a capacitor is that, given most real world power supplies are constant voltage supplies (nominal), max energy stored in a capacitor is not determined by the series resistance $R$. $R$ only determines how long it takes to get to that max energy. But in the case of an inductor, since $R$ affects $I_{max}$ it affects both the time it takes to get to max energy and the max energy itself."

For capacitors and inductors, the ratio between voltage and current is defined as \"reactance\" when it is specifically used in case of exponential signals (and not for DC signals and nor for any other AC signals). Reactance is measured in ohms just like resistance. Ratio between voltage and current for capacitor in the case of exponentials can be found from above equations for $v(t)$ and $i(t)$ as:\n",

    "## Capacitor as a non-wasting power reducer\n",
    "If we want to reduce AC power going to a load, we can use a series resistor: Old fan regulators used a bunch of resistors to change the speed of the fan. However this method is inefficient as the regulating resistor burns power. An alternative is to use electronic phase control switches, such as a DIAC-TRIAC combo. These electronic regulators burn little power, but they produce a ringing noise because they are chopping off parts of the AC sine wave to reduce power to the load. A capacitor in series with the load has none of these problems. Without a capacitor, the power burnt at the load (modeled by resistance $R$ would be:\n",

    "## Nuance about AC/DC\n",
    "Originally the terms meant current flowing in one direction and current changing direction respectively. This was related to power transmission. However the DC in power transmission is pulsating - raising and falling in voltage - and in a purely resistive circuit, would correspondingly have raising and falling current, which nevertheless flows in one direction. But a pulsating voltage/current in the context of designing filters, amplifiers, oscillators etc. would be theoretically decomposed to a DC component, which is the average value that remains steady and an AC component that is changing in value. So a sinusoidal signal swinging from 8V to 2V would be thought of as containing a 5V stead DC component and an AC component swinging from 3V to -3V. One should not let theoretical concept confuse them on the directionality of the current.For instance consider the following circuit:\n",

    "While the voltage at any side of R2 never goes negative, the voltage on R1 (at the meeting point of R1 and C1) swings to negative side. And the current in the circuit reverses direction constantly. Since R1 and R2 are both in series, the current through both of them changes direction constantly. So while the voltage in R2 is never negative, the current still flows both ways. This is again due to where we place the reference point as discussed in the *Voltage, Current..* section at the top. This kind of stresses on the reason why we talk about AC and DC in transmission lines, based on current direction, rather than AV and DV based on voltage values\n",

    "In a similar arrangement to the above circuit in amplifiers (imagine R1 replaced by a NON transistor's base-emitter), they talk about the capacitor \"blocking\" the DC voltage and passing only the AC voltage, which is misleading since there is no such a thing as a DC or AC voltage! For instance, if we only moved the reference point as shown below, suddenly the voltage on R2 close to the power source would now swing into the negative side, while the voltage on R1 (close to the capacitor) would entirely be on the negative side - meaning it would have a negative DC component if we were to decompose it into a DC component and an AC component.

    "# A note on capacitor, inductor discharging\n",
    "+ The easiest way to think about the voltage and current values of an inductor discharging is to remember that an inductor wants to keep the current at the same level through it as it was just before discharging. Consider the circuit below where the load is a very high resistance, say 1 mega ohms.\n",

    "\n",
    "During the charging time, the load would experience the source voltage, which, let us say, is 12V. When the power is disconnected (say, using a switch) and the current through the inductor at that time is 1A, the inductor would want to continue that 1A no matter the load resistance value. In our case, this creates g a potential difference of 1 mega volt - a million volts - across the load! This extreme voltage condition stays for a tiny fraction of a second, of course, but it is nevertheless amazing. This property can be exploited in applications where we need to create high voltages using a small battery - such as in the case of the 12V battery of a car to generate a spark in the spark plug. \n",
    "+ One way to safely switch off an inductive load such as a motor is to have a freewheeling diode with or without a small resistor which would ensure crazy voltages don't appear during the discharge creating arcing or killing components. \n",
    "+ Capacitor discharging can be thought of in a similar way. Capacitor likes to continue with the voltage that was there just before the discharge. It doesn't matter how small the load is. For instance, if we used two switches - one to charge the capacitor and another to discharge it on a small load, say, 1 ohms. A 12V battery, if directly connected to a 1 ohm resistor may never be able to supply 12A due to its internal resistance. However if we could charge the capacitor for a while, it would eventually reach 12V. And then if we disconnect the power and connect the load, the capacitor would discharge 12A. If the load was 0.1 ohms, then the capacitor would discharge 120A (for a tiny fraction of a second, after which it would decline quickly). This nature of the capacitor can be exploited in applicaitons such as flashlights used in photography and spot welding\n",
    "+ Real world inductors and capacitors always have internal resistances. However these tend to be much smaller than that of power sources.\n",
    "+ In some applications a capacitor is used as an electric sponge to absorb the energy from an inductive load when it is turned off and then give it back to the inductor when it is turned on. This is basically a mini version of regenerative braking. In cars, when regenerative braking is applied by introducting a heavy load - one can imagine a capacitor fed by a step transformer so to provide higher voltage levels required for charging the battery. The braking is similar to what happens in the gravity assisted LED light.  "

    "Many more configurations are possible, including using darlington pairs. The diodes are freewheeling diodes used to make a discharging path for the motor when it is switched off. Circuits with FETs make use of the internal body diodes and hence usually don't use external diodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a reason why H-bridges have four separate control pins instead of bunching them up into two (one for clockwise and the other for anti-clockwise spinning of motor) as shown in the first diagram above: In that circuit, when after A is turned on for a while, A is switched off (with B remaining switched off throughout this time),the motor would discharge through D3 and D2, forming a circuit through the power supply. This is OK in some cases where the power supply has very little resistance (such as the case in batteries) and where the motor doesn't have to slow down quickly. If the power supply isn't a low resistance supply, a capacitor in parellel to the supply should solve that problem. The motor won't slow down quickly because the diodes are light loads (relatively higher resistance). A faster braking can be achieved by turning on Q4 and D2 because the transistor ON resistance will be relatively lower than that of the diode - By eliminating one diode, we can create a lower reistance path and achieve faster braking of the motor - But this whole thing is possible only if we have individual control of all four inputs of the H-bridge. And with this method, we also won't need a power supply or a capacitor to soak up the discharge. Faster braking is useful in robotic applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note here that Q2 cannot be turned on because the base of the NPN needs to be at a higher volage than the motor positive voltage which may not be possible since the typical application of H-bridge is a microcontroller controlling switches with low voltages to turn ON and OFF high voltages going to the motor. Also note that one could switch on Q1 and create a discharge path through D3 and Q1 to achieve the same thing as discharging through Q4 and D2. It is actually advisable to use these two paths alternatively during switch offs so as to improve the life of all the components invovled by reducing thermal wear. I will let you imagine the paths of discharge when B direction is switched off. \n",

    "AC to DC can be accomplished using rectifiers or switches that are combined with controlling circuitry. Oscillators are an easy way to convert DC to AC, but not necessarily the best way. Pendulum clock and Shishi Odoshi are mechanical DC to AC converters. The former converts a falling DC weight to oscillations and the latter converts one way water flow to bidirectional oscillations of the bamboo pipe. THe pendulum clock is an example of a sinusoidal oscillator and the Shishi Odoshi, of a bidirectional spiking relaxation oscillator."
