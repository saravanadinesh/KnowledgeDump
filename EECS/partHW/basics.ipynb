    "# How batteries work\n",
    "[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5TqMuHaDuY) has the most acceptable explanation of all. Here is my unerstanding so far: A solution is something that will have positively charge ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions) existing in a lose form. So the solution overall is neutral. But as these ions are swimming around, they could react with things. A cell is made up of two half cells. The basic cell everyone uses to explain how a cell works consists of a zinc electrode submerged in a zinc nitrate solution making one half cell and a copper electrode dipped in a copper nitrate solution forming another half cell. Initially, the zinc electrode reacts with one of the swimming nitrate anions and releases two electrons. These electrons travel through the wire connecting the two electrodes to the copper electrode because the copper cations in the copper nitrate solution attract them. The result is that one zinc atom (gets oxidised) gets released into the zinc nitrate solution making it positively charged overall (because there is now one zinc cation too many in the solution. On the copper side, one copper cation gains two electrons and (gets reduced) becomes a copper atom leaving the solution and attaching to the copper electrode, making the copper nitrate solution slightly negatively charged. All of this is possible only because shit is swimming around in the solution - if cations and anions are attached tightly to each other, none of this would happen. Here is where it gets even more vague: After a point, the copper solution is too negatively charged and zinc solution two negatively charged for the swimming motherfuckers to continue reacting with their respective electrodes. Now comes the salt bridge - It is another solution, like potassium nitrate, that connects the zinc nitrate and copper nitrate solutions. This bridge allows the extra cations on one side to migrate over to the other side and extra anions to come over to this side. One may ask, if there is a salt bridge, why the electrons didn't go over the salt bridge instead of the wire. So apparently electrons have to remain very close to protons and that means they can travel only by jumping from one atom to another atom which is literally rubbing this atom. In a metal wire, these atoms are all right next to each other and hence this is possible. But in a solution, the atoms are too far away from one another for this to happen. \n",

    "# Capacitors\n",
    "A capacitor is like a diaphragm in a hydraudic system. When a pressure is applied at one end of the pipe containing the diaphragm, the diaphragm initially will show no resistance and start deforming. As it deforms, the fluid at both ends of the pipe will move making it seem like the fluid (current) is going through (whereas it actually isn't). But if the pressure is steadily applied (flat DC or increasing DC), then, at some point, the diaphragm will reach its max deformation and will fully resist (infinite resistance) - Or, it will break if the applied pressure is more than what the diaphragm can resist.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a capacitor faces an AC voltage, basically a push-pull happening repeatedly in a hydraulic system, then the diaphragm will keep deforming a little bit and go back to original form repeatedly. It will look like fluid is flowing back and forth the pipe containing the diaphragm. This is why a capacitor appears as a low resistance to AC voltages\n",

It is like accumulting river water over a long period of time in a water tank and then releasing all the water through a large pipe (low resistance) very quickly. This is achieved by using transistor valves, one on the input and one on the output of the capacitor. Basically the input valve would be closed, while the output valve is open and the capacitor charged to its max capacity and the input valve is opened and the output valve closed to discharge the accumulated energy onto a load. Since we already have the voltage and current equations for a simple capacitor charging and discharging circuits, we can derive the equations for the charging energy $E_C(T)$ and discharging energy $E_D(T)$ as:\n",

    "One can think of capacitance as the elasticity of a membrane in a hydraulic system - the more elastic it is, higher will be the energy that can be stored in it. Of course, if one where to apply very high pressure continuously on the membrane, it may push it beyond its breaking point and the membrane will simply tear - Capacitors have the same problem and hence come with voltage ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "One can find out that, during the charging phase, when $T=6R_SC$, the capacitor reaches 99.75% of its max value. Assuming that during the charging phase, we charged the capacitor for longer than this time, when we go to the discharge phase, we can approximate the initial voltage on the capacitor $v_{Ci}$ to be the same as the battery voltage $v_b$. Imagine a 100mAh LiPo battery that is rated at 1C. So it can supply upto 100mA at 3.7V, i.e., 370mW. Say we use a $100\\mu F$ cap, then we can accumulate a maximum of $1850\\mu J$, and then, if the load resistance $R_L = 1\\Omega$, we can discharge almost the entire energy in $600\\mu s$ resulting in an average of $3W$ power supply during that time. That is approximately an 8x gain. While energy dissipation from a capacitor can be dramatic, current supply can be even more dramatic. At the very instant discharging valve is closed, the current supply is 3.7A in the above example. Comparing that to 100mA, it is a 37x gain!\n",
