    "## UART\n",
    "+ Asynchronous serial protocol\n",
    "+ Requires pull-up\n",
    "+ Dedicated lines for Tx and Rx (typically labelled TXD, RXD)\n",
    "+ Baud rate (i.e. symbol rate) is basically bit rate including start, stop, party bits etc.\n",
    "+ Typical bit rates are 10, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 128000 and 256000 bits per second\n",
    "\n",
    "The [reason why](https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/semiconductor/knowledge/e-learning/mcu-sim/fn369sio_id/fn369sio_d3.html) the baud rate in UART mode is 1/16 of clocks\n",
    "Unlike in synchronous communication, UART has no clocks to determine the data. Instead, the transmit side and the receive side determine the transmission speed, called the baud rate, and the bit configuration in advance, and determine the data position according to the start bit. \n",

    "<img src=\"uartclk.png\" width=1000/> \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the case of 9600 bauds, each bit interval (\"a\" in the figure) is about 104 μs. The data output timing of the transmit side is indicated by a green arrow in the figure. On the receive side, the data is fetched in the part indicated by a red arrow in the figure. To realize this, the clock supplied to the UART receive part uses one with 16 times as many as the baud rate. The data are confirmed in 7th clock, 8th clock, and 9th clock, and judged 0 or 1 by majority. Sometimes instead of 16x clock, the receiver might use 8x or some other x. \n",

    "## I2C\n",
    "+ Inter IC protocol\n",
    "+ Synchronous serial protocol\n",
    "+ Contains data and clock labelled SDA, SCL. SDA is used both for Tx and Rx.\n",
    "+ Both lines require pullup\n",
    "+ Typical speed is 100Kbps. There is a 400Kbps fast mode, 1Mbps fast mode +, 3.4 Mbps high speed mode and 5Mbps ultra fast mode\n",

    "# Bluetooth\n",
    "Bluetooth operates at frequencies between 2.402 and 2.480 GHz. It uses frequency hopping spread sprectrum. Regular bluetooth divides data into packets, loading each into one of the 79 bands that are each 1MHz wide. BLE uses 40 bands, each 2MHz wide. In the most widely used mode, transmission power is limited to 2.5 milliwatts, giving it a very short range of up to 10 metres (33 ft). Bluetooth version 4.0 or later contain BLE mode (which has a max 1Mbps throughput). The latest version is 5.3. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normal bluetooth has a master-slave concept. A master can be connected to many slaves, but a slave can only be connected to one master. A network of a master and many slaves is called a \"Piconet\". A master can talk to any slave, request data. But two slaves can't talk to each other. Every bluetooth device has a unique 48-bit address. There are three bluetooth power classes, each defined by max output power/range, namely 100mW/100m, 2.5mW/10m, 1mW/10cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bluetooth can operate in various \"profiles\" namely:\n",
    "  - Serial port profile (SPP) - This is basically wireless RS232\n",
    "  - Human interface device (HID) - This is for mouse, keyboard etc.\n",
    "  - Hands-free, Headset profile - Two way audio, low bandwidth\n",
    "  - Advanced audio distribution profile (A2DP) - For playing music on BT headphones. One way, high bandwidth\n",
    "  - A/V remote control profile (AVRCP) - Typically used along with A2DP for the headphones to tell the music playing device to up/down the volume, move to the next music etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In BLE, there is a master-slave concept as well as a client-server concept. Master (PC/Smartphone) scans, while slave only advertises and participates in pairing if the master wants. The master is most often also the client as it asks the server, which is often the slave, to perform a task. Client can *read* data from the server or *write* data to it. It can also enable the *notify*, *indicate* operations, whereas the operations themselves are performed by the server - this is a way to push data to the client. Notifications are unacknowledged, while indications are acknowledged. Just as in normal bluetooth, a master can connect to many slaves, but a slave can connect to only one master. \n",
    "\n",
    "The client/server of BLE are called GATT (General ATTribute) client/server. The client/server concept is logically distrinct from master/slave concept. It is possible that a single device, master or a slave, can be both a GATT server and a client at the same time. A GATT server has a GATT database that implements one or more *profiles*, and each *profile* is made up of one or more *services*, and each *service* is made up of one or more *characteristics*. For example, the *Heart rate* profile has a *Heart rate* service and *Device Information* service (which is a mandatory service for all profiles). The *Heart rate* service must have a *Heart rate measurement* characteristic, and optionally, *Body sensor location* and *Heart rate control point* characteristics. Every service has a UUID and every characteristic has a UUID. \n",

    "# Switches and Indicators\n",
    "## Switches\n",
    "BJT and MOSFET are used for DC switching only. While switching is a current based operation for BJT, it is a voltage based operation for MOSFET. So MOSFET may be advantageous to use with a microcontroller. Note that we are talking about the overall power consumption, but just the demand on the switching system (ex. a microcontroller). Also BJT has a negative temperature coefficient - meaning its ON resistance decreases with voltage -which may result in thermal run away and hece would require some extra circuit to prevent that. MOSFET however has a postitive temperature coefficient. An advantage of BJT is that when Vcc fluctuates, for a given base current, the output current remains steady. So BJTs are suitable for applications such as ligthing LEDs (whose brightness is proportional to current). Apparently IGBT is a cross between BJT and MOSFET. Power MOSFETs and Power BJTs can be used for high power applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thyristors have a latching feature - they remain ON after a current trigger pulse is supplied to the gate. Triacs, SCRs are different types of Thyristors. Whereas SCRs can conduct current only in one direction, Triacs can conduct current in both directions, which makes them suitable for some AC applications. [Special care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIAC) must be taken while using TRIACs with inductive or capactive loads (like using snubber circuits). DIACs aren't switches in the traditional sense of the word. They basically act as open circuit until the applied voltage crosses a point and then break down and become a short. This makes DIACs can be useful for making simple pulsing circuits (ex. relaxation oscillators for car indicators). Note that DIACs can conduct current in both directions. This makes them useful for phase control applications when combined with TRAICs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optocouplers can be used for switching a circuit that is galvanically isolated from the switch controlling mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relays are versatile (if bulky) switches that can be used in low or high voltage DC or AC applications and relays provide galvanic isolation. But they are not suitable for fast switching applications.Contactors are basically high voltage, high current relays. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Low side vs. High side switching\n",
    "N-Channel MOSFETs are used for low side switching and P-channels ones are used for high side swithcing. Similarly for BJTs, PNP is used for high side switching and NPN is used for low side switching. The reason has got to do with the gate/base to source/emitter voltage requirement for switching. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Indicators\n",
    "Neon lamps are used as an indicator in high voltage systems (like a tester). But neon lamps have many other use cases such as being used as a component to make a simple relaxation oscialltor or a voltage reference source in high voltage circuit (like a 90v reference voltage) or for flicker flame circuits. Neon lamps are very rugged and not affected by vibration, mechanical shock, or frequent ON/OFF operation. Neon lamps may be operated over a wide temperature range from -40 to +150˚C and are not damaged by voltage transients of high voltage static discharges. In high voltage applications, it requires very little or no accompanying circuit and it draws very little current while glowing. \n",

    "# Useful electronic components\n",
    "**Schmitt Trigger** is very useful to remove noise in digital inputs (like clocks, interrupt input pins). In fact many ICs (such as clock counters, microcontrollers) have built in schmitt trigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "# PID control\n",
    "Proportional-Integral-Derivative Control is a basic control systems concept for controlling actuators to achieve an end result. Examples are controlling the current flow to a heater unit to achieve heating up a liquid to a certain temperature, controlling the voltage input of a motor so that a robot moves to a particular spatial location and controlling the propeller of a drone so that it reaches certain height. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let us take the example of getting a robot to its destination. Imagine that it has a ultrasonic range detector and the detector is pointing at a wall, thus measuring the distance between the robot and the wall. Let us say the wall is 51m away and we want to robot to move straight and stop just 1m (Set point SP) away from the wall. In other words, we want the ultrasonic sensor to output - called the process variable (PV) - to get to the set point from 51m. We know that we need to control the motor that powers the wheels of the robot so that we   Let us first think about just the proportinal part in the control loop shown above. In our case, the setpoint (tau(t)) is a fixed value. Initially the error will be 51m-1m = 50m. With only the proportional part in action, our control variable (CV) u(t) will be set to Kp\\*50 (volts). Assuming the speed of the motor varies linearly with the applied voltage, it will spin at some Kp\\*50\\*rpmfactor speed. As the robot moves closer to the wall, the error term will decrease, causing the controller mechanism to reduce the speed of the motor in a proportional manner. So the robot will start moving fast in the beginning, gradually slowing down as it approaches the wall, and when it has reached the destination point, come to a stop as the CV will become zero at the point and the robot will stop. Note here that Kp controls how quickly the robot gets to the set point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So proportional control is sufficient for the robot example above. However imagine a situation where after reaching the set point value, we need the CV to be non-zero forever in order to remain at the set point: Take for example a heating system where after achieving a certain temperature, we need to keep supplying the heating element some amount of current so that the temperature will remain at the set point - This is because a small amount of heat is being continuously dissipated to the surroundings and so we need to continuously keep the heating on to compensate for that. Similarly, suppose we need to get a drone fly up to a 100m, we can't turn off the propeller when it reaches 100m - it needs to be spinning at a certain rpm continuously to remain at 100m. Again, this is because gravity is continuously acting on the drone. In other words, u(t) needs to have an additional factor besides Kp\\*e(t) which attains a particular steady state value when SP is reached. This is where the integral part of the PID control comes in. \n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative part of PID control can basically be thought of as something that controls the acceleration of the motor or temperature curve whereas the proportional part only controls the speed. This is because of acceleration is the derivative of speed. In the robot example, we could set the Kp to be a high value so that the robot accelerates quickly towards its destination. However, when that happens, the error is going to decline just as quickly and derivative of it will be a large negative value. This value, scaled and then added with the output of the proportional block will dampen the value of u(t). In other words the derivative part can be thought of as adding a measure of damping to the system and hence preventing (or reducing) overshoots.  \n",

    "  + Voltage input range to the motor cannot be below 0V or above a max value\n",
    "  + Drone height can't be negative\n",
    "  + While using proportional part alone, Kp should be chosen such than Kp\\*error (volts) is large enough to produce a propeller force that can defeat gravity (approximately 50 newtons)\n",
